//Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
//citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the
//researcher's h-index.
//According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h
//if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h
//papers have no more than h citations each.
//If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the
//h-index.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of
//them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
//Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the
//remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: citations = [1,3,1]
//Output: 1
// 
//Constraints:
//n == citations.length
//1 <= n <= 5000
//0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
