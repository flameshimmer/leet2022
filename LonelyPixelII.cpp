//Given an m x n picture consisting of black 'B' and white 'W' pixels and an
//integer target, return the number of black lonely pixels.
//A black lonely pixel is a character 'B' that located at a specific position (r,
//c) where:
//Row r and column c both contain exactly target black pixels.
//For all rows that have a black pixel at column c, they should be exactly the
//same as row r.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//[["W","B","W","B","B","W"],["W","B","W","B","B","W"],["W","B","W","B","B","W"],["W","W","B","W","B","W"]],
//target = 3
//Output: 6
//Explanation: All the green 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column
//1 and 3).
//Take 'B' at row r = 0 and column c = 1 as an example:
// - Rule 1, row r = 0 and column c = 1 both have exactly target = 3 black
//pixels. 
// - Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column c = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row
//2. They are exactly the same as row r = 0.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: picture = [["W","W","B"],["W","W","B"],["W","W","B"]], target = 1
//Output: 0
// 
//Constraints:
//m == picture.length
//n == picture[i].length
//1 <= m, n <= 200
//picture[i][j] is 'W' or 'B'.
//1 <= target <= min(m, n)
