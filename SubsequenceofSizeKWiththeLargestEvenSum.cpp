//You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the largest even sum
//of any subsequence of nums that has a length of k.
//Return this sum, or -1 if such a sum does not exist.
//A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
//some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [4,1,5,3,1], k = 3
//Output: 12
//Explanation:
//The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,5,3]. It has a sum of
//4 + 5 + 3 = 12.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: nums = [4,6,2], k = 3
//Output: 12
//Explanation:
//The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,6,2]. It has a sum of
//4 + 6 + 2 = 12.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: nums = [1,3,5], k = 1
//Output: -1
//Explanation:
//No subsequence of nums with length 1 has an even sum.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 <= nums.length <= 105
//0 <= nums[i] <= 105
//1 <= k <= nums.length
