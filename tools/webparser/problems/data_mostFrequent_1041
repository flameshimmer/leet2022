{"title":"1215. Stepping Numbers","description":"A stepping number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1.\n\nFor example, 321 is a stepping number while 421 is not.\n\nGiven two integers low and high, return a sorted list of all the stepping numbers in the inclusive range [low, high].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: low = 0, high = 21\nOutput: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,21]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: low = 10, high = 15\nOutput: [10,12]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= low <= high <= 2 * 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> countSteppingNumbers(int low, int high) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
