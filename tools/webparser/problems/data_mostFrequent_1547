{"title":"785. Is Graph Bipartite?","description":"There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:\n\nThere are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).\nThere are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).\nIf v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).\nThe graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.\n\nA graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.\n\nReturn true if and only if it is bipartite.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\ngraph.length == n\n1 <= n <= 100\n0 <= graph[u].length < n\n0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1\ngraph[u] does not contain u.\nAll the values of graph[u] are unique.\nIf graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
