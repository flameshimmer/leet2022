{"title":"986. Interval List Intersections","description":"You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.\n\nReturn the intersection of these two interval lists.\n\nA closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.\n\nThe intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]\nOutput: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []\nOutput: []\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000\nfirstList.length + secondList.length >= 1\n0 <= starti < endi <= 109\nendi < starti+1\n0 <= startj < endj <= 109\nendj < startj+1","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& firstList, vector<vector<int>>& secondList) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
