{"title":"294. Flip Game II","description":"You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.\n\nYou are given a string currentState that contains only '+' and '-'. You and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive \"++\" into \"--\". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.\n\nReturn true if the starting player can guarantee a win, and false otherwise.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: currentState = \"++++\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle \"++\" to become \"+--+\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: currentState = \"+\"\nOutput: false\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= currentState.length <= 60\ncurrentState[i] is either '+' or '-'.\n\n \n\nFollow up: Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool canWin(string currentState) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
