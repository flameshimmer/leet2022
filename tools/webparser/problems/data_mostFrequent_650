{"title":"672. Bulb Switcher II","description":"There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:\n\nButton 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.\nButton 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).\nButton 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).\nButton 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).\n\nYou must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.\n\nGiven the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 1, presses = 1\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Status can be:\n- [off] by pressing button 1\n- [on] by pressing button 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 2, presses = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Status can be:\n- [off, off] by pressing button 1\n- [on, off] by pressing button 2\n- [off, on] by pressing button 3\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 3, presses = 1\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Status can be:\n- [off, off, off] by pressing button 1\n- [off, on, off] by pressing button 2\n- [on, off, on] by pressing button 3\n- [off, on, on] by pressing button 4\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= presses <= 1000","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int flipLights(int n, int presses) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
