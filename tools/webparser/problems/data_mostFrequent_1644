{"title":"1345. Jump Game IV","description":"Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.\n\nIn one step you can jump from index i to index:\n\ni + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.\ni - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.\nj where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.\n\nReturn the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.\n\nNotice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [7]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Start index is the last index. You do not need to jump.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104\n-108 <= arr[i] <= 108","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
