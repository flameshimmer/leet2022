{"title":"516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence","description":"Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"bbbab\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is \"bbbb\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"cbbd\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is \"bb\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
