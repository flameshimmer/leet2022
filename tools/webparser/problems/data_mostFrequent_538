{"title":"1805. Number of Different Integers in a String","description":"You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.\n\nYou will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, \"a123bc34d8ef34\" will become \" 123  34 8  34\". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: \"123\", \"34\", \"8\", and \"34\".\n\nReturn the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.\n\nTwo integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: word = \"a123bc34d8ef34\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The three different integers are \"123\", \"34\", and \"8\". Notice that \"34\" is only counted once.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word = \"leet1234code234\"\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: word = \"a1b01c001\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The three integers \"1\", \"01\", and \"001\" all represent the same integer because\nthe leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 1000\nword consists of digits and lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numDifferentIntegers(string word) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
