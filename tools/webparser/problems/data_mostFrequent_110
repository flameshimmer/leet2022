{"title":"327. Count of Range Sum","description":"Given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.\n\nRange sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j inclusive, where i <= j.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\n-105 <= lower <= upper <= 105\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countRangeSum(vector<int>& nums, int lower, int upper) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
