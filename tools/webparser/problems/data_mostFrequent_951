{"title":"563. Binary Tree Tilt","description":"Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.\n\nThe tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nTilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)\nTilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)\nTilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)\nSum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: \nTilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)\nTilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)\nTilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)\nTilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)\nTilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)\nTilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)\nSum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: 9\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    int findTilt(TreeNode* root) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
