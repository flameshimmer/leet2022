{"title":"1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List","description":"Given the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).\n\nReturn the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorites companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: favoriteCompanies = [[\"leetcode\",\"google\",\"facebook\"],[\"google\",\"microsoft\"],[\"google\",\"facebook\"],[\"google\"],[\"amazon\"]]\nOutput: [0,1,4] \nExplanation: \nPerson with index=2 has favoriteCompanies[2]=[\"google\",\"facebook\"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[\"leetcode\",\"google\",\"facebook\"] corresponding to the person with index 0. \nPerson with index=3 has favoriteCompanies[3]=[\"google\"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[\"leetcode\",\"google\",\"facebook\"] and favoriteCompanies[1]=[\"google\",\"microsoft\"]. \nOther lists of favorite companies are not a subset of another list, therefore, the answer is [0,1,4].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: favoriteCompanies = [[\"leetcode\",\"google\",\"facebook\"],[\"leetcode\",\"amazon\"],[\"facebook\",\"google\"]]\nOutput: [0,1] \nExplanation: In this case favoriteCompanies[2]=[\"facebook\",\"google\"] is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[\"leetcode\",\"google\",\"facebook\"], therefore, the answer is [0,1].\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: favoriteCompanies = [[\"leetcode\"],[\"google\"],[\"facebook\"],[\"amazon\"]]\nOutput: [0,1,2,3]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100\n1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500\n1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20\nAll strings in favoriteCompanies[i] are distinct.\nAll lists of favorite companies are distinct, that is, If we sort alphabetically each list then favoriteCompanies[i] != favoriteCompanies[j].\nAll strings consist of lowercase English letters only.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> peopleIndexes(vector<vector<string>>& favoriteCompanies) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
