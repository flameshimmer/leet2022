{"title":"1165. Single-Row Keyboard","description":"There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.\n\nGiven a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.\n\nYou want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: keyboard = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", word = \"cba\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.\nTotal time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: keyboard = \"pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno\", word = \"leetcode\"\nOutput: 73\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nkeyboard.length == 26\nkeyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.\n1 <= word.length <= 104\nword[i] is an English lowercase letter.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int calculateTime(string keyboard, string word) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
