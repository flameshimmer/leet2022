{"title":"2145. Count the Hidden Sequences","description":"You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].\n\nYou are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.\n\nFor example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).\n[3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.\n[5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.\n[1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.\n\nReturn the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The possible hidden sequences are:\n- [3, 4, 1, 5]\n- [4, 5, 2, 6]\nThus, we return 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: differences = [3,-4,5,1,-2], lower = -4, upper = 5\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The possible hidden sequences are:\n- [-3, 0, -4, 1, 2, 0]\n- [-2, 1, -3, 2, 3, 1]\n- [-1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 2]\n- [0, 3, -1, 4, 5, 3]\nThus, we return 4.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: differences = [4,-7,2], lower = 3, upper = 6\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no possible hidden sequences. Thus, we return 0.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == differences.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n-105 <= differences[i] <= 105\n-105 <= lower <= upper <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numberOfArrays(vector<int>& differences, int lower, int upper) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
