{"title":"2043. Simple Bank System","description":"You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].\n\nExecute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:\n\nThe given account number(s) are between 1 and n, and\nThe amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is less than or equal to the balance of the account.\n\nImplement the Bank class:\n\nBank(long[] balance) Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array balance.\nboolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money) Transfers money dollars from the account numbered account1 to the account numbered account2. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\nboolean deposit(int account, long money) Deposit money dollars into the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\nboolean withdraw(int account, long money) Withdraw money dollars from the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"Bank\", \"withdraw\", \"transfer\", \"deposit\", \"transfer\", \"withdraw\"]\n[[[10, 100, 20, 50, 30]], [3, 10], [5, 1, 20], [5, 20], [3, 4, 15], [10, 50]]\nOutput\n[null, true, true, true, false, false]\n\nExplanation\nBank bank = new Bank([10, 100, 20, 50, 30]);\nbank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has a balance of $20, so it is valid to withdraw $10.\n                         // Account 3 has $20 - $10 = $10.\nbank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has a balance of $30, so it is valid to transfer $20.\n                         // Account 5 has $30 - $20 = $10, and account 1 has $10 + $20 = $30.\nbank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, it is valid to deposit $20 to account 5.\n                         // Account 5 has $10 + $20 = $30.\nbank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, the current balance of account 3 is $10,\n                         // so it is invalid to transfer $15 from it.\nbank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, it is invalid because account 10 does not exist.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == balance.length\n1 <= n, account, account1, account2 <= 105\n0 <= balance[i], money <= 1012\nAt most 104 calls will be made to each function transfer, deposit, withdraw.","functionSig":"1\nclass Bank {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    Bank(vector<long long>& balance) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n    \n7\n    bool transfer(int account1, int account2, long long money) {\n8\n        \n9\n    }\n10\n    \n11\n    bool deposit(int account, long long money) {\n12\n        \n13\n    }\n14\n    \n15\n    bool withdraw(int account, long long money) {\n16\n        \n17\n    }\n18\n};\n19\n​\n20\n/**\n21\n * Your Bank object will be instantiated and called as such:\n22\n * Bank* obj = new Bank(balance);\n23\n * bool param_1 = obj->transfer(account1,account2,money);\n24\n * bool param_2 = obj->deposit(account,money);\n25\n * bool param_3 = obj->withdraw(account,money);\n26\n */"}
