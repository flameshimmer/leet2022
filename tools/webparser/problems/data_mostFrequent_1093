{"title":"1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer","description":"You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:\n\nPick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).\nPick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.\nReplace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.\nThe new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.\n\nLet a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively.\n\nReturn the max difference between a and b.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = 555\nOutput: 888\nExplanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.\nThe second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.\nWe have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = 9\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.\nThe second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.\nWe have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num <= 108","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxDiff(int num) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
