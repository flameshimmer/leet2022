{"title":"1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String","description":"You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.\n\nWe say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.\n\nFor example, if s1 = \"abc\" and s2 = \"cde\", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.\n\nEquivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:\n\nReflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.\nSymmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.\nTransitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.\n\nFor example, given the equivalency information from s1 = \"abc\" and s2 = \"cde\", \"acd\" and \"aab\" are equivalent strings of baseStr = \"eed\", and \"aab\" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.\n\nReturn the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s1 = \"parker\", s2 = \"morris\", baseStr = \"parser\"\nOutput: \"makkek\"\nExplanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].\nThe characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.\nSo the answer is \"makkek\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"world\", baseStr = \"hold\"\nOutput: \"hdld\"\nExplanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].\nSo only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is \"hdld\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s1 = \"leetcode\", s2 = \"programs\", baseStr = \"sourcecode\"\nOutput: \"aauaaaaada\"\nExplanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is \"aauaaaaada\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000\ns1.length == s2.length\ns1, s2, and baseStr consist of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
