{"title":"392. Is Subsequence","description":"Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\" while \"aec\" is not).\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"axc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"\nOutput: false\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length <= 100\n0 <= t.length <= 104\ns and t consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n \n\nFollow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
