{"title":"1905. Count Sub Islands","description":"You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.\n\nAn island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an island in grid1 that contains all the cells that make up this island in grid2.\n\nReturn the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.\nThe 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]\nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.\nThe 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid1.length == grid2.length\nn == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 500\ngrid1[i][j] and grid2[i][j] are either 0 or 1.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countSubIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid1, vector<vector<int>>& grid2) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
