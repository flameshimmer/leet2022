{"title":"1056. Confusing Number","description":"A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a different number with each digit valid.\n\nWe can rotate digits of a number by 180 degrees to form new digits.\n\nWhen 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, and 6 respectively.\nWhen 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid.\n\nNote that after rotating a number, we can ignore leading zeros.\n\nFor example, after rotating 8000, we have 0008 which is considered as just 8.\n\nGiven an integer n, return true if it is a confusing number, or false otherwise.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We get 9 after rotating 6, 9 is a valid number, and 9 != 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 89\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We get 68 after rotating 89, 68 is a valid number and 68 != 89.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 11\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We get 11 after rotating 11, 11 is a valid number but the value remains the same, thus 11 is not a confusing number\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= n <= 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool confusingNumber(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
