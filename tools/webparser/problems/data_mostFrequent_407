{"title":"1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends","description":"There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array logs where logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi] indicates that xi and yi will be friends at the time timestampi.\n\nFriendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.\n\nReturn the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6\nOutput: 20190301\nExplanation: \nThe first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\nThe second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].\nThe third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].\nThe fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].\nThe fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friends anything happens.\nThe sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4\nOutput: 3\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 100\n1 <= logs.length <= 104\nlogs[i].length == 3\n0 <= timestampi <= 109\n0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1\nxi != yi\nAll the values timestampi are unique.\nAll the pairs (xi, yi) occur at most one time in the input.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int earliestAcq(vector<vector<int>>& logs, int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
