{"title":"1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations","description":"You are given an array target and an integer n.\n\nIn each iteration, you will read a number from list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n].\n\nBuild the target array using the following operations:\n\n\"Push\": Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array.\n\"Pop\": Deletes the last element of the array.\nIf the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.\n\nReturn a list of the operations needed to build target. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: target = [1,3], n = 3\nOutput: [\"Push\",\"Push\",\"Pop\",\"Push\"]\nExplanation: \nRead number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]\nRead number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]\nRead number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: target = [1,2,3], n = 3\nOutput: [\"Push\",\"Push\",\"Push\"]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: target = [1,2], n = 4\nOutput: [\"Push\",\"Push\"]\nExplanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= target.length <= 100\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= target[i] <= n\ntarget is strictly increasing.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
