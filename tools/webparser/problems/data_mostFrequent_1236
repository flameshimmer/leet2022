{"title":"1655. Distribute Repeating Integers","description":"You are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array. You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:\n\nThe ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,\nThe integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and\nEvery customer is satisfied.\n\nReturn true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4], quantity = [2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The 0th customer cannot be given two different integers.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3], quantity = [2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The 0th customer is given [3,3]. The integers [1,2] are not used.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,2,2], quantity = [2,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The 0th customer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [2,2].\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 1000\nm == quantity.length\n1 <= m <= 10\n1 <= quantity[i] <= 105\nThere are at most 50 unique values in nums.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool canDistribute(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& quantity) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
