{"title":"812. Largest Triangle Area","description":"Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]\nOutput: 2.00000\nExplanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: 0.50000\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= points.length <= 50\n-50 <= xi, yi <= 50\nAll the given points are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
