{"title":"1773. Count Items Matching a Rule","description":"You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.\n\nThe ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:\n\nruleKey == \"type\" and ruleValue == typei.\nruleKey == \"color\" and ruleValue == colori.\nruleKey == \"name\" and ruleValue == namei.\n\nReturn the number of items that match the given rule.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: items = [[\"phone\",\"blue\",\"pixel\"],[\"computer\",\"silver\",\"lenovo\"],[\"phone\",\"gold\",\"iphone\"]], ruleKey = \"color\", ruleValue = \"silver\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is [\"computer\",\"silver\",\"lenovo\"].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: items = [[\"phone\",\"blue\",\"pixel\"],[\"computer\",\"silver\",\"phone\"],[\"phone\",\"gold\",\"iphone\"]], ruleKey = \"type\", ruleValue = \"phone\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are [\"phone\",\"blue\",\"pixel\"] and [\"phone\",\"gold\",\"iphone\"]. Note that the item [\"computer\",\"silver\",\"phone\"] does not match.\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= items.length <= 104\n1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10\nruleKey is equal to either \"type\", \"color\", or \"name\".\nAll strings consist only of lowercase letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countMatches(vector<vector<string>>& items, string ruleKey, string ruleValue) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
