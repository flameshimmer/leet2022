{"title":"1197. Minimum Knight Moves","description":"In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].\n\nA knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.\n\nReturn the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: x = 2, y = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: x = 5, y = 5\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n-300 <= x, y <= 300\n0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minKnightMoves(int x, int y) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
