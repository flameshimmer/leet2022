{"title":"906. Super Palindromes","description":"Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.\n\nGiven two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: left = \"4\", right = \"1000\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.\nNote that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: left = \"1\", right = \"2\"\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18\nleft and right consist of only digits.\nleft and right cannot have leading zeros.\nleft and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1].\nleft is less than or equal to right.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int superpalindromesInRange(string left, string right) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
