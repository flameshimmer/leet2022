{"title":"1088. Confusing Number II","description":"A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a different number with each digit valid.\n\nWe can rotate digits of a number by 180 degrees to form new digits.\n\nWhen 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, and 6 respectively.\nWhen 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid.\n\nNote that after rotating a number, we can ignore leading zeros.\n\nFor example, after rotating 8000, we have 0008 which is considered as just 8.\n\nGiven an integer n, return the number of confusing numbers in the inclusive range [1, n].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 20\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19].\n6 converts to 9.\n9 converts to 6.\n10 converts to 01 which is just 1.\n16 converts to 91.\n18 converts to 81.\n19 converts to 61.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 100\nOutput: 19\nExplanation: The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19,60,61,66,68,80,81,86,89,90,91,98,99,100].\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int confusingNumberII(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
