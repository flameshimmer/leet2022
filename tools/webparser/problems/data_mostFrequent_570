{"title":"2021. Brightest Position on Street","description":"A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has street lamp(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array lights. Each lights[i] = [positioni, rangei] indicates that there is a street lamp at position positioni that lights up the area from [positioni - rangei, positioni + rangei] (inclusive).\n\nThe brightness of a position p is defined as the number of street lamp that light up the position p.\n\nGiven lights, return the brightest position on the street. If there are multiple brightest positions, return the smallest one.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: lights = [[-3,2],[1,2],[3,3]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from [(-3) - 2, (-3) + 2] = [-5, -1].\nThe second street lamp lights up the area from [1 - 2, 1 + 2] = [-1, 3].\nThe third street lamp lights up the area from [3 - 3, 3 + 3] = [0, 6].\n\nPosition -1 has a brightness of 2, illuminated by the first and second street light.\nPositions 0, 1, 2, and 3 have a brightness of 2, illuminated by the second and third street light.\nOut of all these positions, -1 is the smallest, so return it.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: lights = [[1,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from [1 - 0, 1 + 0] = [1, 1].\nThe second street lamp lights up the area from [0 - 1, 0 + 1] = [-1, 1].\n\nPosition 1 has a brightness of 2, illuminated by the first and second street light.\nReturn 1 because it is the brightest position on the street.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: lights = [[1,2]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from [1 - 2, 1 + 2] = [-1, 3].\n\nPositions -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 have a brightness of 1, illuminated by the first street light.\nOut of all these positions, -1 is the smallest, so return it.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= lights.length <= 105\nlights[i].length == 2\n-108 <= positioni <= 108\n0 <= rangei <= 108","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int brightestPosition(vector<vector<int>>& lights) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
