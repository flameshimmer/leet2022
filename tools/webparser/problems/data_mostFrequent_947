{"title":"2288. Apply Discount to Prices","description":"A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign '$'. A word represents a price if it is a sequence of digits preceded by a dollar sign.\n\nFor example, \"$100\", \"$23\", and \"$6\" represent prices while \"100\", \"$\", and \"$1e5\" do not.\n\nYou are given a string sentence representing a sentence and an integer discount. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of discount% on the price and update the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with exactly two decimal places.\n\nReturn a string representing the modified sentence.\n\nNote that all prices will contain at most 10 digits.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: sentence = \"there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop\", discount = 50\nOutput: \"there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop\"\nExplanation: \nThe words which represent prices are \"$1\" and \"$2\". \n- A 50% discount on \"$1\" yields \"$0.50\", so \"$1\" is replaced by \"$0.50\".\n- A 50% discount on \"$2\" yields \"$1\". Since we need to have exactly 2 decimal places after a price, we replace \"$2\" with \"$1.00\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sentence = \"1 2 $3 4 $5 $6 7 8$ $9 $10$\", discount = 100\nOutput: \"1 2 $0.00 4 $0.00 $0.00 7 8$ $0.00 $10$\"\nExplanation: \nApplying a 100% discount on any price will result in 0.\nThe words representing prices are \"$3\", \"$5\", \"$6\", and \"$9\".\nEach of them is replaced by \"$0.00\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sentence.length <= 105\nsentence consists of lowercase English letters, digits, ' ', and '$'.\nsentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.\nAll words in sentence are separated by a single space.\nAll prices will be positive integers without leading zeros.\nAll prices will have at most 10 digits.\n0 <= discount <= 100","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string discountPrices(string sentence, int discount) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
