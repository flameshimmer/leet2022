{"title":"1714. Sum Of Special Evenly-Spaced Elements In Array","description":"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of n non-negative integers.\n\nYou are also given an array queries, where queries[i] = [xi, yi]. The answer to the ith query is the sum of all nums[j] where xi <= j < n and (j - xi) is divisible by yi.\n\nReturn an array answer where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is the answer to the ith query modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], queries = [[0,3],[5,1],[4,2]]\nOutput: [9,18,10]\nExplanation: The answers of the queries are as follows:\n1) The j indices that satisfy this query are 0, 3, and 6. nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[6] = 9\n2) The j indices that satisfy this query are 5, 6, and 7. nums[5] + nums[6] + nums[7] = 18\n3) The j indices that satisfy this query are 4 and 6. nums[4] + nums[6] = 10\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [100,200,101,201,102,202,103,203], queries = [[0,7]]\nOutput: [303]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 5 * 104\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n1 <= queries.length <= 1.5 * 105\n0 <= xi < n\n1 <= yi <= 5 * 104","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> solve(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
