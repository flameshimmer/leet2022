{"title":"564. Find the Closest Palindrome","description":"Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.\n\nThe closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = \"123\"\nOutput: \"121\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = \"1\"\nOutput: \"0\"\nExplanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n.length <= 18\nn consists of only digits.\nn does not have leading zeros.\nn is representing an integer in the range [1, 1018 - 1].","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string nearestPalindromic(string n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
