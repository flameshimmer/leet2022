{"title":"734. Sentence Similarity","description":"We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence \"I am happy with leetcode\" can be represented as arr = [\"I\",\"am\",happy\",\"with\",\"leetcode\"].\n\nGiven two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.\n\nReturn true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.\n\nTwo sentences are similar if:\n\nThey have the same length (i.e., the same number of words)\nsentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.\n\nNotice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar, and the words b and c are similar, a and c are not necessarily similar.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"great\",\"acting\",\"skills\"], sentence2 = [\"fine\",\"drama\",\"talent\"], similarPairs = [[\"great\",\"fine\"],[\"drama\",\"acting\"],[\"skills\",\"talent\"]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"great\"], sentence2 = [\"great\"], similarPairs = []\nOutput: true\nExplanation: A word is similar to itself.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"great\"], sentence2 = [\"doubleplus\",\"good\"], similarPairs = [[\"great\",\"doubleplus\"]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: As they don't have the same length, we return false.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000\n1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20\nsentence1[i] and sentence2[i] consist of English letters.\n0 <= similarPairs.length <= 1000\nsimilarPairs[i].length == 2\n1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20\nxi and yi consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.\nAll the pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool areSentencesSimilar(vector<string>& sentence1, vector<string>& sentence2, vector<vector<string>>& similarPairs) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
