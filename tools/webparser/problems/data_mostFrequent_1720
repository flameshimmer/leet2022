{"title":"450. Delete Node in a BST","description":"Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.\n\nBasically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:\n\nSearch for a node to remove.\nIf the node is found, delete the node.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3\nOutput: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]\nExplanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.\nOne valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.\nPlease notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0\nOutput: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]\nExplanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [], key = 0\nOutput: []\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-105 <= Node.val <= 105\nEach node has a unique value.\nroot is a valid binary search tree.\n-105 <= key <= 105\n\n \n\nFollow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
