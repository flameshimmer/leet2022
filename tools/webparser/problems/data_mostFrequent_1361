{"title":"2143. Choose Numbers From Two Arrays in Range","description":"You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n.\n\nA range [l, r] (inclusive) where 0 <= l <= r < n is balanced if:\n\nFor every i in the range [l, r], you pick either nums1[i] or nums2[i].\nThe sum of the numbers you pick from nums1 equals to the sum of the numbers you pick from nums2 (the sum is considered to be 0 if you pick no numbers from an array).\n\nTwo balanced ranges from [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are considered to be different if at least one of the following is true:\n\nl1 != l2\nr1 != r2\nnums1[i] is picked in the first range, and nums2[i] is picked in the second range or vice versa for at least one i.\n\nReturn the number of different ranges that are balanced. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,5], nums2 = [2,6,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The balanced ranges are:\n- [0, 1] where we choose nums2[0], and nums1[1].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 2 = 2.\n- [0, 2] where we choose nums1[0], nums2[1], and nums1[2].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 1 + 5 = 6.\n- [0, 2] where we choose nums1[0], nums1[1], and nums2[2].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 1 + 2 = 3.\nNote that the second and third balanced ranges are different.\nIn the second balanced range, we choose nums2[1] and in the third balanced range, we choose nums1[1].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums1 = [0,1], nums2 = [1,0]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The balanced ranges are:\n- [0, 0] where we choose nums1[0].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 0 = 0.\n- [1, 1] where we choose nums2[1].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 0 = 0.\n- [0, 1] where we choose nums1[0] and nums2[1].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 0 = 0.\n- [0, 1] where we choose nums2[0] and nums1[1].\n  The sum of the numbers chosen from nums1 equals the sum of the numbers chosen from nums2: 1 = 1.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums1.length == nums2.length\n1 <= n <= 100\n0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countSubranges(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
