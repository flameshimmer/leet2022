{"title":"1331. Rank Transform of an Array","description":"Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank.\n\nThe rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:\n\nRank is an integer starting from 1.\nThe larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.\nRank should be as small as possible.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [40,10,20,30]\nOutput: [4,1,2,3]\nExplanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [100,100,100]\nOutput: [1,1,1]\nExplanation: Same elements share the same rank.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]\nOutput: [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= arr.length <= 105\n-109 <= arr[i] <= 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> arrayRankTransform(vector<int>& arr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
