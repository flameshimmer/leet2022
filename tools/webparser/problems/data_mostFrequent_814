{"title":"998. Maximum Binary Tree II","description":"A maximum tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.\n\nYou are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer val.\n\nJust as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from a list a (root = Construct(a)) recursively with the following Construct(a) routine:\n\nIf a is empty, return null.\nOtherwise, let a[i] be the largest element of a. Create a root node with the value a[i].\nThe left child of root will be Construct([a[0], a[1], ..., a[i - 1]]).\nThe right child of root will be Construct([a[i + 1], a[i + 2], ..., a[a.length - 1]]).\nReturn root.\n\nNote that we were not given a directly, only a root node root = Construct(a).\n\nSuppose b is a copy of a with the value val appended to it. It is guaranteed that b has unique values.\n\nReturn Construct(b).\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5\nOutput: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]\nExplanation: a = [1,4,2,3], b = [1,4,2,3,5]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3\nOutput: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]\nExplanation: a = [2,1,5,4], b = [2,1,5,4,3]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4\nOutput: [5,2,4,null,1,3]\nExplanation: a = [2,1,5,3], b = [2,1,5,3,4]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nAll the values of the tree are unique.\n1 <= val <= 100","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
