{"title":"1439. Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows","description":"You are given an m x n matrix mat that has its rows sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer k.\n\nYou are allowed to choose exactly one element from each row to form an array.\n\nReturn the kth smallest array sum among all possible arrays.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 5\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:\n[1,2], [1,4], [3,2], [3,4], [1,6]. Where the 5th sum is 7.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 9\nOutput: 17\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,10,10],[1,4,5],[2,3,6]], k = 7\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:\n[1,1,2], [1,1,3], [1,4,2], [1,4,3], [1,1,6], [1,5,2], [1,5,3]. Where the 7th sum is 9.  \n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == mat.length\nn == mat.length[i]\n1 <= m, n <= 40\n1 <= mat[i][j] <= 5000\n1 <= k <= min(200, nm)\nmat[i] is a non-decreasing array.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
