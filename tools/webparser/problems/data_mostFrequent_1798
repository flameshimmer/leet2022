{"title":"97. Interleaving String","description":"Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.\n\nAn interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:\n\ns = s1 + s2 + ... + sn\nt = t1 + t2 + ... + tm\n|n - m| <= 1\nThe interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...\n\nNote: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s1 = \"aabcc\", s2 = \"dbbca\", s3 = \"aadbbcbcac\"\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s1 = \"aabcc\", s2 = \"dbbca\", s3 = \"aadbbbaccc\"\nOutput: false\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s1 = \"\", s2 = \"\", s3 = \"\"\nOutput: true\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100\n0 <= s3.length <= 200\ns1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n \n\nFollow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
