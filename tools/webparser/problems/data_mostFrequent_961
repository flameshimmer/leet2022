{"title":"248. Strobogrammatic Number III","description":"Given two strings low and high that represent two integers low and high where low <= high, return the number of strobogrammatic numbers in the range [low, high].\n\nA strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: low = \"50\", high = \"100\"\nOutput: 3\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: low = \"0\", high = \"0\"\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= low.length, high.length <= 15\nlow and high consist of only digits.\nlow <= high\nlow and high do not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int strobogrammaticInRange(string low, string high) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
