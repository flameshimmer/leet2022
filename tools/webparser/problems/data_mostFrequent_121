{"title":"990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations","description":"You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: \"xi==yi\" or \"xi!=yi\".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.\n\nReturn true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: equations = [\"a==b\",\"b!=a\"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.\nThere is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: equations = [\"b==a\",\"a==b\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= equations.length <= 500\nequations[i].length == 4\nequations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.\nequations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'.\nequations[i][2] is '='.\nequations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool equationsPossible(vector<string>& equations) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
