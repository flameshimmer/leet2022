{"title":"2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K","description":"The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length.\n\nFor example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.\n\nGiven a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays of nums whose score is strictly less than k.\n\nA subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nThe 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:\n- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.\n- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.\n- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.\n- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. \n- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.\n- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.\nNote that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1], k = 5\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nEvery subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.\n[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.\nThus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n1 <= k <= 1015","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, long long k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
