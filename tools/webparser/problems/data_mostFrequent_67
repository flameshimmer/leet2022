{"title":"1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern","description":"You are given two string arrays username and website and an integer array timestamp. All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple [username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]] indicates that the user username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].\n\nA pattern is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).\n\nFor example, [\"home\", \"away\", \"love\"], [\"leetcode\", \"love\", \"leetcode\"], and [\"luffy\", \"luffy\", \"luffy\"] are all patterns.\n\nThe score of a pattern is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.\n\nFor example, if the pattern is [\"home\", \"away\", \"love\"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited \"home\" then visited \"away\" and visited \"love\" after that.\nSimilarly, if the pattern is [\"leetcode\", \"love\", \"leetcode\"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited \"leetcode\" then visited \"love\" and visited \"leetcode\" one more time after that.\nAlso, if the pattern is [\"luffy\", \"luffy\", \"luffy\"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited \"luffy\" three different times at different timestamps.\n\nReturn the pattern with the largest score. If there is more than one pattern with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: username = [\"joe\",\"joe\",\"joe\",\"james\",\"james\",\"james\",\"james\",\"mary\",\"mary\",\"mary\"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = [\"home\",\"about\",\"career\",\"home\",\"cart\",\"maps\",\"home\",\"home\",\"about\",\"career\"]\nOutput: [\"home\",\"about\",\"career\"]\nExplanation: The tuples in this example are:\n[\"joe\",\"home\",1],[\"joe\",\"about\",2],[\"joe\",\"career\",3],[\"james\",\"home\",4],[\"james\",\"cart\",5],[\"james\",\"maps\",6],[\"james\",\"home\",7],[\"mary\",\"home\",8],[\"mary\",\"about\",9], and [\"mary\",\"career\",10].\nThe pattern (\"home\", \"about\", \"career\") has score 2 (joe and mary).\nThe pattern (\"home\", \"cart\", \"maps\") has score 1 (james).\nThe pattern (\"home\", \"cart\", \"home\") has score 1 (james).\nThe pattern (\"home\", \"maps\", \"home\") has score 1 (james).\nThe pattern (\"cart\", \"maps\", \"home\") has score 1 (james).\nThe pattern (\"home\", \"home\", \"home\") has score 0 (no user visited home 3 times).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: username = [\"ua\",\"ua\",\"ua\",\"ub\",\"ub\",\"ub\"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6], website = [\"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]\nOutput: [\"a\",\"b\",\"a\"]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= username.length <= 50\n1 <= username[i].length <= 10\ntimestamp.length == username.length\n1 <= timestamp[i] <= 109\nwebsite.length == username.length\n1 <= website[i].length <= 10\nusername[i] and website[i] consist of lowercase English letters.\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three websites.\nAll the tuples [username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]] are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> mostVisitedPattern(vector<string>& username, vector<int>& timestamp, vector<string>& website) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
