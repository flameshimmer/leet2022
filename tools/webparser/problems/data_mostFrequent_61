{"title":"1604. Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period","description":"LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.\n\nYou are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.\n\nAccess times are given in the 24-hour time format \"HH:MM\", such as \"23:51\" and \"09:49\".\n\nReturn a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.\n\nNotice that \"10:00\" - \"11:00\" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while \"22:51\" - \"23:52\" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: keyName = [\"daniel\",\"daniel\",\"daniel\",\"luis\",\"luis\",\"luis\",\"luis\"], keyTime = [\"10:00\",\"10:40\",\"11:00\",\"09:00\",\"11:00\",\"13:00\",\"15:00\"]\nOutput: [\"daniel\"]\nExplanation: \"daniel\" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period (\"10:00\",\"10:40\", \"11:00\").\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: keyName = [\"alice\",\"alice\",\"alice\",\"bob\",\"bob\",\"bob\",\"bob\"], keyTime = [\"12:01\",\"12:00\",\"18:00\",\"21:00\",\"21:20\",\"21:30\",\"23:00\"]\nOutput: [\"bob\"]\nExplanation: \"bob\" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period (\"21:00\",\"21:20\", \"21:30\").\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= keyName.length, keyTime.length <= 105\nkeyName.length == keyTime.length\nkeyTime[i] is in the format \"HH:MM\".\n[keyName[i], keyTime[i]] is unique.\n1 <= keyName[i].length <= 10\nkeyName[i] contains only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> alertNames(vector<string>& keyName, vector<string>& keyTime) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
