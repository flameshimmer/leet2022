{"title":"1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String","description":"You are given a string s.\n\nA split is called good if you can split s into two non-empty strings sleft and sright where their concatenation is equal to s (i.e., sleft + sright = s) and the number of distinct letters in sleft and sright is the same.\n\nReturn the number of good splits you can make in s.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aacaba\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 5 ways to split \"aacaba\" and 2 of them are good. \n(\"a\", \"acaba\") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.\n(\"aa\", \"caba\") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.\n(\"aac\", \"aba\") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).\n(\"aaca\", \"ba\") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).\n(\"aacab\", \"a\") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Split the string as follows (\"ab\", \"cd\").\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numSplits(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
