{"title":"2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads","description":"You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.\n\nYou need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.\n\nReturn the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]\nOutput: 43\nExplanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].\n- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.\n- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.\n- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.\n- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.\n- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.\n- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.\nThe total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.\nIt can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].\n- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.\n- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.\n- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.\nThe total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.\nIt can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 5 * 104\n1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 104\nroads[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1\nai != bi\nThere are no duplicate roads.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
