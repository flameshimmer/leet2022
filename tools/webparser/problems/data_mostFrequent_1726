{"title":"28. Implement strStr()","description":"Implement strStr().\n\nGiven two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.\n\nClarification:\n\nWhat should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: haystack = \"hello\", needle = \"ll\"\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: haystack = \"aaaaa\", needle = \"bba\"\nOutput: -1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104\nhaystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
