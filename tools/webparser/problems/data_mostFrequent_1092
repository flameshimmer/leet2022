{"title":"1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid","description":"You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).\n\nGiven n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5000\nOutput: 30228214\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length\n1 <= n <= 5000","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numOfWays(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
