{"title":"541. Reverse String II","description":"Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.\n\nIf there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcdefg\", k = 2\nOutput: \"bacdfeg\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", k = 2\nOutput: \"bacd\"\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n1 <= k <= 104","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
