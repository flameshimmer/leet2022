Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression","description":"In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i + 1] - arr[i] are all equal for every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.\n\nA value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.\n\nGiven arr, return the removed value.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [5,7,11,13]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [15,13,12]\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= arr.length <= 1000\n0 <= arr[i] <= 105\nThe given array is guaranteed to be a valid array.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
