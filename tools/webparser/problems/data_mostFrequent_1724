{"title":"526. Beautiful Arrangement","description":"Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:\n\nperm[i] is divisible by i.\ni is divisible by perm[i].\n\nGiven an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:\n    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1\n    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2\nThe second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:\n    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1\n    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 15","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countArrangement(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
