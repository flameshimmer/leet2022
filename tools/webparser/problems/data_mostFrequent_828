{"title":"737. Sentence Similarity II","description":"We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence \"I am happy with leetcode\" can be represented as arr = [\"I\",\"am\",happy\",\"with\",\"leetcode\"].\n\nGiven two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.\n\nReturn true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.\n\nTwo sentences are similar if:\n\nThey have the same length (i.e., the same number of words)\nsentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.\n\nNotice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar, and the words b and c are similar, then a and c are similar.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"great\",\"acting\",\"skills\"], sentence2 = [\"fine\",\"drama\",\"talent\"], similarPairs = [[\"great\",\"good\"],[\"fine\",\"good\"],[\"drama\",\"acting\"],[\"skills\",\"talent\"]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"I\",\"love\",\"leetcode\"], sentence2 = [\"I\",\"love\",\"onepiece\"], similarPairs = [[\"manga\",\"onepiece\"],[\"platform\",\"anime\"],[\"leetcode\",\"platform\"],[\"anime\",\"manga\"]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \"leetcode\" --> \"platform\" --> \"anime\" --> \"manga\" --> \"onepiece\".\nSince \"leetcode is similar to \"onepiece\" and the first two words are the same, the two sentences are similar.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: sentence1 = [\"I\",\"love\",\"leetcode\"], sentence2 = [\"I\",\"love\",\"onepiece\"], similarPairs = [[\"manga\",\"hunterXhunter\"],[\"platform\",\"anime\"],[\"leetcode\",\"platform\"],[\"anime\",\"manga\"]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \"leetcode\" is not similar to \"onepiece\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000\n1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20\nsentence1[i] and sentence2[i] consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.\n0 <= similarPairs.length <= 2000\nsimilarPairs[i].length == 2\n1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20\nxi and yi consist of English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool areSentencesSimilarTwo(vector<string>& sentence1, vector<string>& sentence2, vector<vector<string>>& similarPairs) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
