{"title":"979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree","description":"You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.\n\nIn one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.\n\nReturn the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,0,0]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [0,3,0]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is n.\n1 <= n <= 100\n0 <= Node.val <= n\nThe sum of all Node.val is n.","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
