{"title":"330. Patching Array","description":"Given a sorted integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.\n\nReturn the minimum number of patches required.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3], n = 6\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nCombinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.\nNow if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].\nPossible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].\nSo we only need 1 patch.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i] <= 104\nnums is sorted in ascending order.\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
