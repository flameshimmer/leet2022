{"title":"1927. Sum Game","description":"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.\n\nYou are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:\n\nChoose an index i where num[i] == '?'.\nReplace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.\n\nThe game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.\n\nFor Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.\n\nFor example, if the game ended with num = \"243801\", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = \"243803\", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.\n\nAssuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = \"5023\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There are no moves to be made.\nThe sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = \"25??\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: num = \"?3295???\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible outcome is:\n- Alice replaces the first '?' with '9'. num = \"93295???\".\n- Bob replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '9'. num = \"932959??\".\n- Alice replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '2'. num = \"9329592?\".\n- Bob replaces the last '?' in the right half with '7'. num = \"93295927\".\nBob wins because 9 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 5 + 9 + 2 + 7.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= num.length <= 105\nnum.length is even.\nnum consists of only digits and '?'.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool sumGame(string num) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
