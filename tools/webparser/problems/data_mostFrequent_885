{"title":"1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word","description":"Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: patterns = [\"a\",\"abc\",\"bc\",\"d\"], word = \"abc\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n- \"a\" appears as a substring in \"abc\".\n- \"abc\" appears as a substring in \"abc\".\n- \"bc\" appears as a substring in \"abc\".\n- \"d\" does not appear as a substring in \"abc\".\n3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: patterns = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"], word = \"aaaaabbbbb\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- \"a\" appears as a substring in \"aaaaabbbbb\".\n- \"b\" appears as a substring in \"aaaaabbbbb\".\n- \"c\" does not appear as a substring in \"aaaaabbbbb\".\n2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: patterns = [\"a\",\"a\",\"a\"], word = \"ab\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word \"ab\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= patterns.length <= 100\n1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100\n1 <= word.length <= 100\npatterns[i] and word consist of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numOfStrings(vector<string>& patterns, string word) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
