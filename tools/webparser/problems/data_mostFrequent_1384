{"title":"2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions","description":"You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.\n\nYou are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.\n\nReturn an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7\nOutput: [4,0,3]\nExplanation:\n- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.\n- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.\n- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.\nThus, [4,0,3] is returned.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16\nOutput: [2,0,2]\nExplanation:\n- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.\n- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. \n- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. \nThus, [2,0,2] is returned.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == spells.length\nm == potions.length\n1 <= n, m <= 105\n1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105\n1 <= success <= 1010","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
