{"title":"268. Missing Number","description":"Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,0,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 104\n0 <= nums[i] <= n\nAll the numbers of nums are unique.\n\n \n\nFollow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
