{"title":"1739. Building Boxes","description":"You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:\n\nYou can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.\nIf box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.\n\nGiven an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minimumBoxes(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
