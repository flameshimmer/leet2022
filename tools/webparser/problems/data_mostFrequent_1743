{"title":"161. One Edit Distance","description":"Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.\n\nA string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:\n\nInsert exactly one character into s to get t.\nDelete exactly one character from s to get t.\nReplace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"ab\", t = \"acb\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"\", t = \"\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104\ns and t consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isOneEditDistance(string s, string t) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
