{"title":"2113. Elements in Array After Removing and Replacing Elements","description":"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Initially on minute 0, the array is unchanged. Every minute, the leftmost element in nums is removed until no elements remain. Then, every minute, one element is appended to the end of nums, in the order they were removed in, until the original array is restored. This process repeats indefinitely.\n\nFor example, the array [0,1,2] would change as follows: [0,1,2] → [1,2] → [2] → [] → [0] → [0,1] → [0,1,2] → [1,2] → [2] → [] → [0] → [0,1] → [0,1,2] → ...\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array queries of size n where queries[j] = [timej, indexj]. The answer to the jth query is:\n\nnums[indexj] if indexj < nums.length at minute timej\n-1 if indexj >= nums.length at minute timej\n\nReturn an integer array ans of size n where ans[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [0,1,2], queries = [[0,2],[2,0],[3,2],[5,0]]\nOutput: [2,2,-1,0]\nExplanation:\nMinute 0: [0,1,2] - All elements are in the nums.\nMinute 1: [1,2]   - The leftmost element, 0, is removed.\nMinute 2: [2]     - The leftmost element, 1, is removed.\nMinute 3: []      - The leftmost element, 2, is removed.\nMinute 4: [0]     - 0 is added to the end of nums.\nMinute 5: [0,1]   - 1 is added to the end of nums.\n\nAt minute 0, nums[2] is 2.\nAt minute 2, nums[0] is 2.\nAt minute 3, nums[2] does not exist.\nAt minute 5, nums[0] is 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2], queries = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0]]\nOutput: [2,-1,2,-1]\nMinute 0: [2] - All elements are in the nums.\nMinute 1: []  - The leftmost element, 2, is removed.\nMinute 2: [2] - 2 is added to the end of nums.\nMinute 3: []  - The leftmost element, 2, is removed.\n\nAt minute 0, nums[0] is 2.\nAt minute 1, nums[0] does not exist.\nAt minute 2, nums[0] is 2.\nAt minute 3, nums[0] does not exist.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n0 <= nums[i] <= 100\nn == queries.length\n1 <= n <= 105\nqueries[j].length == 2\n0 <= timej <= 105\n0 <= indexj < nums.length","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> elementInNums(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
