{"title":"236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree","description":"Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\n\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].\n-109 <= Node.val <= 109\nAll Node.val are unique.\np != q\np and q will exist in the tree.","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}\n8\n * };\n9\n */\n10\nclass Solution {\n11\npublic:\n12\n    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {\n13\n        \n14\n    }\n15\n};"}
