{"title":"42. Trapping Rain Water","description":"Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]\nOutput: 9\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == height.length\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n0 <= height[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int trap(vector<int>& height) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
