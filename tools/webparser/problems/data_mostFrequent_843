{"title":"955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II","description":"You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.\n\nWe may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.\n\nFor example, if we have strs = [\"abcdef\",\"uvwxyz\"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [\"bef\", \"vyz\"].\n\nSuppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order (i.e., strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n - 1]). Return the minimum possible value of answer.length.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: strs = [\"ca\",\"bb\",\"ac\"]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nAfter deleting the first column, strs = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\nNow strs is in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2]).\nWe require at least 1 deletion since initially strs was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: strs = [\"xc\",\"yb\",\"za\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: \nstrs is already in lexicographic order, so we do not need to delete anything.\nNote that the rows of strs are not necessarily in lexicographic order:\ni.e., it is NOT necessarily true that (strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ...)\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: strs = [\"zyx\",\"wvu\",\"tsr\"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We have to delete every column.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == strs.length\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= strs[i].length <= 100\nstrs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
