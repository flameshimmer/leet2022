{"title":"337. House Robber III","description":"The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.\n\nBesides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.\n\nGiven the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 104","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    int rob(TreeNode* root) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
