{"title":"356. Line Reflection","description":"Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to the y-axis that reflects the given points symmetrically.\n\nIn other words, answer whether or not if there exists a line that after reflecting all points over the given line, the original points' set is the same as the reflected ones.\n\nNote that there can be repeated points.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[1,1],[-1,1]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can choose the line x = 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We can't choose a line.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == points.length\n1 <= n <= 104\n-108 <= points[i][j] <= 108\n\n \n\nFollow up: Could you do better than O(n2)?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isReflected(vector<vector<int>>& points) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
