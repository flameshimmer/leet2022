{"title":"469. Convex Polygon","description":"You are given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi]. The points form a polygon when joined sequentially.\n\nReturn true if this polygon is convex and false otherwise.\n\nYou may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon. In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[0,5],[5,5],[5,0]]\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= points.length <= 104\npoints[i].length == 2\n-104 <= xi, yi <= 104\nAll the given points are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isConvex(vector<vector<int>>& points) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
