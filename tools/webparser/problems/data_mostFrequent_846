{"title":"2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences","description":"Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.\n\nReturn the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.\n\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"leetcodecom\"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose \"ete\" for the 1st subsequence and \"cdc\" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"bb\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose \"b\" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and \"b\" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"accbcaxxcxx\"\nOutput: 25\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose \"accca\" for the 1st subsequence and \"xxcxx\" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 12\ns consists of lowercase English letters only.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxProduct(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
