{"title":"2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List","description":"In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.\n\nFor example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.\n\nThe twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.\n\nGiven the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [5,4,2,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nNodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.\nThere are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [4,2,2,3]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation:\nThe nodes with twins present in this linked list are:\n- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.\n- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. \n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: head = [1,100000]\nOutput: 100001\nExplanation:\nThere is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].\n1 <= Node.val <= 105","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for singly-linked list.\n3\n * struct ListNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     ListNode *next;\n6\n *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}\n7\n *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}\n9\n * };\n10\n */\n11\nclass Solution {\n12\npublic:\n13\n    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {\n14\n        \n15\n    }\n16\n};"}
