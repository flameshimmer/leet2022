{"title":"1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three","description":"Given an array nums of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxSumDivThree(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
