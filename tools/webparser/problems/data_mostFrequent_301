{"title":"444. Sequence Reconstruction","description":"You are given an integer array nums of length n where nums is a permutation of the integers in the range [1, n]. You are also given a 2D integer array sequences where sequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.\n\nCheck if nums is the shortest possible and the only supersequence. The shortest supersequence is a sequence with the shortest length and has all sequences[i] as subsequences. There could be multiple valid supersequences for the given array sequences.\n\nFor example, for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]], there are two shortest supersequences, [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].\nWhile for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]], the only shortest supersequence possible is [1,2,3]. [1,2,3,4] is a possible supersequence but not the shortest.\n\nReturn true if nums is the only shortest supersequence for sequences, or false otherwise.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There are two possible supersequences: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].\nThe sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].\nThe sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].\nSince nums is not the only shortest supersequence, we return false.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2].\nThe sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2].\nSince nums is not the shortest supersequence, we return false.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2,3].\nThe sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].\nThe sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].\nThe sequence [2,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].\nSince nums is the only shortest supersequence, we return true.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 104\nnums is a permutation of all the integers in the range [1, n].\n1 <= sequences.length <= 104\n1 <= sequences[i].length <= 104\n1 <= sum(sequences[i].length) <= 105\n1 <= sequences[i][j] <= n\nAll the arrays of sequences are unique.\nsequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool sequenceReconstruction(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& sequences) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
