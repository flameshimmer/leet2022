{"title":"634. Find the Derangement of An Array","description":"In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.\n\nYou are given an integer n. There is originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, return the number of derangements it can generate. Since the answer may be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 106","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int findDerangement(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
