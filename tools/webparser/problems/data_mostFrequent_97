{"title":"692. Top K Frequent Words","description":"Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.\n\nReturn the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"i\",\"love\",\"leetcode\",\"i\",\"love\",\"coding\"], k = 2\nOutput: [\"i\",\"love\"]\nExplanation: \"i\" and \"love\" are the two most frequent words.\nNote that \"i\" comes before \"love\" due to a lower alphabetical order.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"the\",\"day\",\"is\",\"sunny\",\"the\",\"the\",\"the\",\"sunny\",\"is\",\"is\"], k = 4\nOutput: [\"the\",\"is\",\"sunny\",\"day\"]\nExplanation: \"the\", \"is\", \"sunny\" and \"day\" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 500\n1 <= words[i] <= 10\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nk is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]\n\n \n\nFollow-up: Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
