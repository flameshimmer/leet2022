{"title":"958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree","description":"Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.\n\nIn a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 1000","functionSig":"1\n/**\n2\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n3\n * struct TreeNode {\n4\n *     int val;\n5\n *     TreeNode *left;\n6\n *     TreeNode *right;\n7\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n8\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\n9\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\n10\n * };\n11\n */\n12\nclass Solution {\n13\npublic:\n14\n    bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {\n15\n        \n16\n    }\n17\n};"}
