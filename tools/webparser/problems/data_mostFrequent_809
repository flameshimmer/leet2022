{"title":"1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping","description":"You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:\n\nCharacters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.\nCharacters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.\n\nReturn the string formed after mapping.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"10#11#12\"\nOutput: \"jkab\"\nExplanation: \"j\" -> \"10#\" , \"k\" -> \"11#\" , \"a\" -> \"1\" , \"b\" -> \"2\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"1326#\"\nOutput: \"acz\"\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of digits and the '#' letter.\ns will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string freqAlphabets(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
