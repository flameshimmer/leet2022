{"title":"1067. Digit Count in Range","description":"Given a single-digit integer d and two integers low and high, return the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all integers in the inclusive range [low, right].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The digit d = 1 occurs 6 times in 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.\nNote that the digit d = 1 occurs twice in the number 11.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250\nOutput: 35\nExplanation: The digit d = 3 occurs 35 times in 103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= d <= 9\n1 <= low <= high <= 2 * 108","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int digitsCount(int d, int low, int high) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
