{"title":"374. Guess Number Higher or Lower","description":"We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\n\nI pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.\n\nEvery time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\n\nYou call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:\n\n-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).\n1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).\n0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).\n\nReturn the number that I picked.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 10, pick = 6\nOutput: 6\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, pick = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2, pick = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n1 <= pick <= n","functionSig":"1\n/** \n2\n * Forward declaration of guess API.\n3\n * @param  num   your guess\n4\n * @return       -1 if num is higher than the picked number\n5\n *                1 if num is lower than the picked number\n6\n *               otherwise return 0\n7\n * int guess(int num);\n8\n */\n9\n​\n10\nclass Solution {\n11\npublic:\n12\n    int guessNumber(int n) {\n13\n        \n14\n    }\n15\n};"}
