{"title":"1182. Shortest Distance to Target Color","description":"You are given an array colors, in which there are three colors: 1, 2 and 3.\n\nYou are also given some queries. Each query consists of two integers i and c, return the shortest distance between the given index i and the target color c. If there is no solution return -1.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: colors = [1,1,2,1,3,2,2,3,3], queries = [[1,3],[2,2],[6,1]]\nOutput: [3,0,3]\nExplanation: \nThe nearest 3 from index 1 is at index 4 (3 steps away).\nThe nearest 2 from index 2 is at index 2 itself (0 steps away).\nThe nearest 1 from index 6 is at index 3 (3 steps away).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: colors = [1,2], queries = [[0,3]]\nOutput: [-1]\nExplanation: There is no 3 in the array.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= colors.length <= 5*10^4\n1 <= colors[i] <= 3\n1 <= queries.length <= 5*10^4\nqueries[i].length == 2\n0 <= queries[i][0] < colors.length\n1 <= queries[i][1] <= 3","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> shortestDistanceColor(vector<int>& colors, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
