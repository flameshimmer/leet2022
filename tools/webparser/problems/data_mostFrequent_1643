{"title":"1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram","description":"You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.\n\nReturn the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.\n\nAn Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"bab\", t = \"aba\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = \"bba\" which is anagram of s.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"leetcode\", t = \"practice\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"anagram\", t = \"mangaar\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: \"anagram\" and \"mangaar\" are anagrams. \n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\ns.length == t.length\ns and t consist of lowercase English letters only.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minSteps(string s, string t) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
