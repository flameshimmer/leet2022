{"title":"960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III","description":"You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.\n\nWe may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.\n\nFor example, if we have strs = [\"abcdef\",\"uvwxyz\"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [\"bef\", \"vyz\"].\n\nSuppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has every string (row) in lexicographic order. (i.e., (strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1]), and (strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1]), and so on). Return the minimum possible value of answer.length.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: strs = [\"babca\",\"bbazb\"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is strs = [\"bc\", \"az\"].\nBoth these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] and strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1]).\nNote that strs[0] > strs[1] - the array strs is not necessarily in lexicographic order.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: strs = [\"edcba\"]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row will not be lexicographically sorted.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: strs = [\"ghi\",\"def\",\"abc\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: All rows are already lexicographically sorted.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == strs.length\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= strs[i].length <= 100\nstrs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n ","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
