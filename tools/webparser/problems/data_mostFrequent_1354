{"title":"2093. Minimum Cost to Reach City With Discounts","description":"A series of highways connect n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array highways where highways[i] = [city1i, city2i, tolli] indicates that there is a highway that connects city1i and city2i, allowing a car to go from city1i to city2i and vice versa for a cost of tolli.\n\nYou are also given an integer discounts which represents the number of discounts you have. You can use a discount to travel across the ith highway for a cost of tolli / 2 (integer division). Each discount may only be used once, and you can only use at most one discount per highway.\n\nReturn the minimum total cost to go from city 0 to city n - 1, or -1 if it is not possible to go from city 0 to city n - 1.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 5, highways = [[0,1,4],[2,1,3],[1,4,11],[3,2,3],[3,4,2]], discounts = 1\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\nGo from 0 to 1 for a cost of 4.\nGo from 1 to 4 and use a discount for a cost of 11 / 2 = 5.\nThe minimum cost to go from 0 to 4 is 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 4, highways = [[1,3,17],[1,2,7],[3,2,5],[0,1,6],[3,0,20]], discounts = 20\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\nGo from 0 to 1 and use a discount for a cost of 6 / 2 = 3.\nGo from 1 to 2 and use a discount for a cost of 7 / 2 = 3.\nGo from 2 to 3 and use a discount for a cost of 5 / 2 = 2.\nThe minimum cost to go from 0 to 3 is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: n = 4, highways = [[0,1,3],[2,3,2]], discounts = 0\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nIt is impossible to go from 0 to 3 so return -1.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 1000\n1 <= highways.length <= 1000\nhighways[i].length == 3\n0 <= city1i, city2i <= n - 1\ncity1i != city2i\n0 <= tolli <= 105\n0 <= discounts <= 500\nThere are no duplicate highways.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minimumCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& highways, int discounts) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
