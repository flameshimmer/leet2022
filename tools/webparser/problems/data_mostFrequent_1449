{"title":"679. 24 Game","description":"You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24.\n\nYou are restricted with the following rules:\n\nThe division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.\nFor example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.\nEvery operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.\nFor example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression \"-1 - 1 - 1 - 1\" is not allowed.\nYou cannot concatenate numbers together\nFor example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression \"12 + 12\" is not valid.\n\nReturn true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: cards = [4,1,8,7]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: cards = [1,2,1,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\ncards.length == 4\n1 <= cards[i] <= 9","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool judgePoint24(vector<int>& cards) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
