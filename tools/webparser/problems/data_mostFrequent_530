{"title":"1196. How Many Apples Can You Put into the Basket","description":"You have some apples and a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.\n\nGiven an integer array weight where weight[i] is the weight of the ith apple, return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: weight = [100,200,150,1000]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: weight = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose any 5 of them.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= weight.length <= 103\n1 <= weight[i] <= 103","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxNumberOfApples(vector<int>& weight) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
