{"title":"1924. Erect the Fence II","description":"You are given a 2D integer array trees where trees[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith tree in the garden.\n\nYou are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope possible. The garden is well-fenced only if all the trees are enclosed and the rope used forms a perfect circle. A tree is considered enclosed if it is inside or on the border of the circle.\n\nMore formally, you must form a circle using the rope with a center (x, y) and radius r where all trees lie inside or on the circle and r is minimum.\n\nReturn the center and radius of the circle as a length 3 array [x, y, r]. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: trees = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]\nOutput: [2.00000,2.00000,2.00000]\nExplanation: The fence will have center = (2, 2) and radius = 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: trees = [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]\nOutput: [2.50000,2.00000,1.50000]\nExplanation: The fence will have center = (2.5, 2) and radius = 1.5\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= trees.length <= 3000\ntrees[i].length == 2\n0 <= xi, yi <= 3000","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<double> outerTrees(vector<vector<int>>& trees) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
