{"title":"996. Number of Squareful Arrays","description":"An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.\n\nGiven an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.\n\nTwo permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,17,8]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,2]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 12\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numSquarefulPerms(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
