{"title":"2067. Number of Equal Count Substrings","description":"You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters, and an integer count. A substring of s is said to be an equal count substring if, for each unique letter in the substring, it appears exactly count times in the substring.\n\nReturn the number of equal count substrings in s.\n\nA substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabcbbcc\", count = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe substring that starts at index 0 and ends at index 2 is \"aaa\".\nThe letter 'a' in the substring appears exactly 3 times.\nThe substring that starts at index 3 and ends at index 8 is \"bcbbcc\".\nThe letters 'b' and 'c' in the substring appear exactly 3 times.\nThe substring that starts at index 0 and ends at index 8 is \"aaabcbbcc\".\nThe letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the substring appear exactly 3 times.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", count = 2\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe number of times each letter appears in s is less than count.\nTherefore, no substrings in s are equal count substrings, so return 0.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"a\", count = 5\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe number of times each letter appears in s is less than count.\nTherefore, no substrings in s are equal count substrings, so return 0\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 3 * 104\n1 <= count <= 3 * 104\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int equalCountSubstrings(string s, int count) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
