{"title":"959. Regions Cut By Slashes","description":"An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.\n\nGiven the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.\n\nNote that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\\' is represented as '\\\\'.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [\" /\",\"/ \"]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [\" /\",\"  \"]\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [\"/\\\\\",\"\\\\/\"]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Recall that because \\ characters are escaped, \"\\\\/\" refers to \\/, and \"/\\\\\" refers to /\\.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n1 <= n <= 30\ngrid[i][j] is either '/', '\\', or ' '.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int regionsBySlashes(vector<string>& grid) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
