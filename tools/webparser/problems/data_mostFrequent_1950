{"title":"891. Sum of Subsequence Widths","description":"The width of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence.\n\nGiven an array of integers nums, return the sum of the widths of all the non-empty subsequences of nums. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].\nThe corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.\nThe sum of these widths is 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int sumSubseqWidths(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
