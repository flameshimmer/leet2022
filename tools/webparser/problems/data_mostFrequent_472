{"title":"599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists","description":"Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.\n\nYou need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: list1 = [\"Shogun\",\"Tapioca Express\",\"Burger King\",\"KFC\"], list2 = [\"Piatti\",\"The Grill at Torrey Pines\",\"Hungry Hunter Steakhouse\",\"Shogun\"]\nOutput: [\"Shogun\"]\nExplanation: The only restaurant they both like is \"Shogun\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: list1 = [\"Shogun\",\"Tapioca Express\",\"Burger King\",\"KFC\"], list2 = [\"KFC\",\"Shogun\",\"Burger King\"]\nOutput: [\"Shogun\"]\nExplanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is \"Shogun\" with index sum 1 (0+1).\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000\n1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30\nlist1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.\nAll the stings of list1 are unique.\nAll the stings of list2 are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
