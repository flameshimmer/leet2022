{"title":"943. Find the Shortest Superstring","description":"Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.\n\nYou may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"alex\",\"loves\",\"leetcode\"]\nOutput: \"alexlovesleetcode\"\nExplanation: All permutations of \"alex\",\"loves\",\"leetcode\" would also be accepted.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"catg\",\"ctaagt\",\"gcta\",\"ttca\",\"atgcatc\"]\nOutput: \"gctaagttcatgcatc\"\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 12\n1 <= words[i].length <= 20\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of words are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string shortestSuperstring(vector<string>& words) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
