{"title":"1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring","description":"Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules:\n\nThe number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters.\nThe substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aababcaab\", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Substring \"aab\" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.\nIt satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaaa\", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Substring \"aaa\" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\n1 <= maxLetters <= 26\n1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxFreq(string s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
