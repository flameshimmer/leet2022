{"title":"1969. Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements","description":"You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:\n\nChoose two elements x and y from nums.\nChoose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.\n\nFor example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.\n\nFind the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.\n\nNote: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: p = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: nums = [1].\nThere is only one element, so the product equals that element.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: p = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: nums = [01, 10, 11].\nAny swap would either make the product 0 or stay the same.\nThus, the array product of 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 is already minimized.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: p = 3\nOutput: 1512\nExplanation: nums = [001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]\n- In the first operation we can swap the leftmost bit of the second and fifth elements.\n    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 011, 100, 001, 110, 111].\n- In the second operation we can swap the middle bit of the third and fourth elements.\n    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 001, 110, 001, 110, 111].\nThe array product is 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 7 = 1512, which is the minimum possible product.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= p <= 60","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
