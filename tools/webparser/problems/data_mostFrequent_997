{"title":"774. Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station","description":"You are given an integer array stations that represents the positions of the gas stations on the x-axis. You are also given an integer k.\n\nYou should add k new gas stations. You can add the stations anywhere on the x-axis, and not necessarily on an integer position.\n\nLet penalty() be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new stations.\n\nReturn the smallest possible value of penalty(). Answers within 10-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: stations = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 9\nOutput: 0.50000\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: stations = [23,24,36,39,46,56,57,65,84,98], k = 1\nOutput: 14.00000\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n10 <= stations.length <= 2000\n0 <= stations[i] <= 108\nstations is sorted in a strictly increasing order.\n1 <= k <= 106","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    double minmaxGasDist(vector<int>& stations, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
