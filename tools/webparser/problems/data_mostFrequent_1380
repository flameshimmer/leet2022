{"title":"2237. Count Positions on Street With Required Brightness","description":"You are given an integer n. A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line ranging from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array lights representing the street lamp(s) on the street. Each lights[i] = [positioni, rangei] indicates that there is a street lamp at position positioni that lights up the area from [max(0, positioni - rangei), min(n - 1, positioni + rangei)] (inclusive).\n\nThe brightness of a position p is defined as the number of street lamps that light up the position p. You are given a 0-indexed integer array requirement of size n where requirement[i] is the minimum brightness of the ith position on the street.\n\nReturn the number of positions i on the street between 0 and n - 1 that have a brightness of at least requirement[i].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, lights = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,2]], requirement = [0,2,1,4,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n- The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(n - 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 1] (inclusive).\n- The second street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 2 - 1), min(n - 1, 2 + 1)] = [1, 3] (inclusive).\n- The third street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 3 - 2), min(n - 1, 3 + 2)] = [1, 4] (inclusive).\n\n- Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is greater than requirement[0].\n- Position 1 is covered by the first, second, and third street lamps. It is covered by 3 street lamps which is greater than requirement[1].\n- Position 2 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is covered by 2 street lamps which is greater than requirement[2].\n- Position 3 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is covered by 2 street lamps which is less than requirement[3].\n- Position 4 is covered by the third street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is equal to requirement[4].\n\nPositions 0, 1, 2, and 4 meet the requirement so we return 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, lights = [[0,1]], requirement = [2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\n- The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(n - 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 0] (inclusive).\n- Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is less than requirement[0].\n- We return 0 because no position meets their brightness requirement.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= lights.length <= 105\n0 <= positioni < n\n0 <= rangei <= 105\nrequirement.length == n\n0 <= requirement[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int meetRequirement(int n, vector<vector<int>>& lights, vector<int>& requirement) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
