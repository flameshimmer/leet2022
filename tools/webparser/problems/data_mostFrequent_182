{"title":"1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half","description":"You are given an integer array arr. You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.\n\nReturn the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are removed.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).\nPossible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.\nChoosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has a size greater than half of the size of the old array.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= arr.length <= 105\narr.length is even.\n1 <= arr[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minSetSize(vector<int>& arr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
