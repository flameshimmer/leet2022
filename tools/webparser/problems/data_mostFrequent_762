{"title":"276. Paint Fence","description":"You are painting a fence of n posts with k different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:\n\nEvery post must be painted exactly one color.\nThere cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.\n\nGiven the two integers n and k, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: All the possibilities are shown.\nNote that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there cannot be three posts in a row with the same color.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, k = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 7, k = 2\nOutput: 42\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 50\n1 <= k <= 105\nThe testcases are generated such that the answer is in the range [0, 231 - 1] for the given n and k.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numWays(int n, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
