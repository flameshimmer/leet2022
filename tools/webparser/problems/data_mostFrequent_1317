{"title":"1908. Game of Nim","description":"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with Alice starting first.\n\nIn this game, there are n piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any positive number of stones from a non-empty pile of his or her choice. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.\n\nGiven an integer array piles, where piles[i] is the number of stones in the ith pile, return true if Alice wins, or false if Bob wins.\n\nBoth Alice and Bob play optimally.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: piles = [1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: There is only one possible scenario:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0].\n- On the second turn, there are no stones left for Bob to remove. Alice wins.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: piles = [1,1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0].\n- On the third turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: piles = [1,2,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes three stones from the third pile. piles = [1,2,0].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [1,1,0].\n- On the third turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1,0].\n- On the fourth turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0,0].\n- On the fifth turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == piles.length\n1 <= n <= 7\n1 <= piles[i] <= 7\n\n \n\nFollow-up: Could you find a linear time solution? Although the linear time solution may be beyond the scope of an interview, it could be interesting to know.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool nimGame(vector<int>& piles) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
