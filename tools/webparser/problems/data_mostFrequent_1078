{"title":"1426. Counting Elements","description":"Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: No numbers are counted, cause there is no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 1000\n0 <= arr[i] <= 1000","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countElements(vector<int>& arr) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
