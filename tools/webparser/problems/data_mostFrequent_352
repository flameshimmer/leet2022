{"title":"2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times","description":"You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.\n\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\nA subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.\n\nFor example, \"bba\" is repeated 2 times in the string \"bababcba\", because the string \"bbabba\", constructed by concatenating \"bba\" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string \"bababcba\".\n\nReturn the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"letsleetcode\", k = 2\nOutput: \"let\"\nExplanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: \"let\" and \"ete\".\n\"let\" is the lexicographically largest one.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"bb\", k = 2\nOutput: \"b\"\nExplanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is \"b\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"ab\", k = 2\nOutput: \"\"\nExplanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == s.length\n2 <= n, k <= 2000\n2 <= n < k * 8\ns consists of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(string s, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
