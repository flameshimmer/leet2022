{"title":"256. Paint House","description":"There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.\n\nThe cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix costs.\n\nFor example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...\n\nReturn the minimum cost to paint all houses.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.\nMinimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: costs = [[7,6,2]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\ncosts.length == n\ncosts[i].length == 3\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
