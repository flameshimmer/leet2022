{"title":"1682. Longest Palindromic Subsequence II","description":"A subsequence of a string s is considered a good palindromic subsequence if:\n\nIt is a subsequence of s.\nIt is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).\nIt has an even length.\nNo two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.\n\nFor example, if s = \"abcabcabb\", then \"abba\" is considered a good palindromic subsequence, while \"bcb\" (not even length) and \"bbbb\" (has equal consecutive characters) are not.\n\nGiven a string s, return the length of the longest good palindromic subsequence in s.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"bbabab\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is \"baab\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"dcbccacdb\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is \"dccd\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 250\ns consists of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
