{"title":"1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other","description":"There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.\n\nGiven a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person.\n\nReturn the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other.\n\nSince the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions. \nFirst person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: hats = [[3,5,1],[3,5]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are 4 ways to choose hats:\n(3,5), (5,3), (1,3) and (1,5)\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: hats = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]]\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: Each person can choose hats labeled from 1 to 4.\nNumber of Permutations of (1,2,3,4) = 24.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == hats.length\n1 <= n <= 10\n1 <= hats[i].length <= 40\n1 <= hats[i][j] <= 40\nhats[i] contains a list of unique integers.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numberWays(vector<vector<int>>& hats) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
