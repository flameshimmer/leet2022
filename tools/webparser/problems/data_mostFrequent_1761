{"title":"792. Number of Matching Subsequences","description":"Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\nFor example, \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\".\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcde\", words = [\"a\",\"bb\",\"acd\",\"ace\"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: \"a\", \"acd\", \"ace\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"dsahjpjauf\", words = [\"ahjpjau\",\"ja\",\"ahbwzgqnuk\",\"tnmlanowax\"]\nOutput: 2\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\n1 <= words.length <= 5000\n1 <= words[i].length <= 50\ns and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
