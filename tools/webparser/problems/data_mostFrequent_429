{"title":"2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations","description":"There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:\n\n++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.\n--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.\n\nInitially, the value of X is 0.\n\nGiven an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: operations = [\"--X\",\"X++\",\"X++\"]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: operations = [\"++X\",\"++X\",\"X++\"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: operations = [\"X++\",\"++X\",\"--X\",\"X--\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.\nX--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= operations.length <= 100\noperations[i] will be either \"++X\", \"X++\", \"--X\", or \"X--\".","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
