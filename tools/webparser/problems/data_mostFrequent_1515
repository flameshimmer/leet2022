{"title":"616. Add Bold Tag in String","description":"You are given a string s and an array of strings words. You should add a closed pair of bold tag <b> and </b> to wrap the substrings in s that exist in words. If two such substrings overlap, you should wrap them together with only one pair of closed bold-tag. If two substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you should combine them.\n\nReturn s after adding the bold tags.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcxyz123\", words = [\"abc\",\"123\"]\nOutput: \"<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabbcc\", words = [\"aaa\",\"aab\",\"bc\"]\nOutput: \"<b>aaabbc</b>c\"\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\n0 <= words.length <= 100\n1 <= words[i].length <= 1000\ns and words[i] consist of English letters and digits.\nAll the values of words are unique.\n\n \n\nNote: This question is the same as 758: https://leetcode.com/problems/bold-words-in-string/","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string addBoldTag(string s, vector<string>& words) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
