{"title":"2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number","description":"The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:\n\nIt has a length of k.\nIt is a divisor of num.\n\nGiven integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.\n\nNote:\n\nLeading zeros are allowed.\n0 is not a divisor of any value.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = 240, k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:\n- \"24\" from \"240\": 24 is a divisor of 240.\n- \"40\" from \"240\": 40 is a divisor of 240.\nTherefore, the k-beauty is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = 430043, k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:\n- \"43\" from \"430043\": 43 is a divisor of 430043.\n- \"30\" from \"430043\": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- \"00\" from \"430043\": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- \"04\" from \"430043\": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- \"43\" from \"430043\": 43 is a divisor of 430043.\nTherefore, the k-beauty is 2.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num <= 109\n1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
