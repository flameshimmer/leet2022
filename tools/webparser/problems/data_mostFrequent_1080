{"title":"2229. Check if an Array Is Consecutive","description":"Given an integer array nums, return true if nums is consecutive, otherwise return false.\n\nAn array is consecutive if it contains every number in the range [x, x + n - 1] (inclusive), where x is the minimum number in the array and n is the length of the array.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe minimum value is 1 and the length of nums is 4.\nAll of the values in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [1, 1 + 4 - 1] = [1, 4] = (1, 2, 3, 4) occur in nums.\nTherefore, nums is consecutive.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nThe minimum value is 1 and the length of nums is 2.\nThe value 2 in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [1, 1 + 2 - 1], = [1, 2] = (1, 2) does not occur in nums.\nTherefore, nums is not consecutive.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,5,4]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe minimum value is 3 and the length of nums is 3.\nAll of the values in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [3, 3 + 3 - 1] = [3, 5] = (3, 4, 5) occur in nums.\nTherefore, nums is consecutive.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
