{"title":"1738. Find Kth Largest XOR Coordinate Value","description":"You are given a 2D matrix of size m x n, consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given an integer k.\n\nThe value of coordinate (a, b) of the matrix is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] where 0 <= i <= a < m and 0 <= j <= b < n (0-indexed).\n\nFind the kth largest value (1-indexed) of all the coordinates of matrix.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 1\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The value of coordinate (0,1) is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is the largest value.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 2\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The value of coordinate (0,0) is 5 = 5, which is the 2nd largest value.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The value of coordinate (1,0) is 5 XOR 1 = 4, which is the 3rd largest value.\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == matrix.length\nn == matrix[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 1000\n0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 106\n1 <= k <= m * n","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int kthLargestValue(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
