{"title":"2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths","description":"You are given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of a weighted directed graph. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] denotes that there exists a directed edge from fromi to toi with weight weighti.\n\nLastly, you are given three distinct integers src1, src2, and dest denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.\n\nReturn the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach dest from both src1 and src2 via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.\n\nA subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\nThe above figure represents the input graph.\nThe blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.\nNote that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nThe above figure represents the input graph.\nIt can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 105\n0 <= edges.length <= 105\nedges[i].length == 3\n0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1\nfromi != toi\nsrc1, src2, and dest are pairwise distinct.\n1 <= weight[i] <= 105","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    long long minimumWeight(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int src1, int src2, int dest) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
