{"title":"1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village","description":"There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.\n\nFor each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes where each pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.\n\nReturn the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.\nThe best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can supply water with cost two using one of the three options:\nOption 1:\n  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.\n  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.\nThe total cost will be 2.\nOption 2:\n  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.\n  - Connect house 2 with house 1 with cost 1.\nThe total cost will be 2.\nOption 3:\n  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.\n  - Connect house 1 with house 2 with cost 1.\nThe total cost will be 2.\nNote that we can connect houses 1 and 2 with cost 1 or with cost 2 but we will always choose the cheapest option. \n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 104\nwells.length == n\n0 <= wells[i] <= 105\n1 <= pipes.length <= 104\npipes[j].length == 3\n1 <= house1j, house2j <= n\n0 <= costj <= 105\nhouse1j != house2j","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minCostToSupplyWater(int n, vector<int>& wells, vector<vector<int>>& pipes) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
