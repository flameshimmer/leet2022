{"title":"1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks","description":"You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick.\n\nYou can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.\n\nReturn the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: sticks = [2,4,3]\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].\n1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].\n2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].\nThere is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sticks = [1,8,3,5]\nOutput: 30\nExplanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].\n1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].\n2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].\n3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].\nThere is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: sticks = [5]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sticks.length <= 104\n1 <= sticks[i] <= 104","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int connectSticks(vector<int>& sticks) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
