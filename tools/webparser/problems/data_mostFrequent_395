{"title":"681. Next Closest Time","description":"Given a time represented in the format \"HH:MM\", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.\n\nYou may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, \"01:34\", \"12:09\" are all valid. \"1:34\", \"12:9\" are all invalid.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: time = \"19:34\"\nOutput: \"19:39\"\nExplanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.\nIt is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: time = \"23:59\"\nOutput: \"22:22\"\nExplanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22.\nIt may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\ntime.length == 5\ntime is a valid time in the form \"HH:MM\".\n0 <= HH < 24\n0 <= MM < 60","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string nextClosestTime(string time) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
