{"title":"836. Rectangle Overlap","description":"An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.\n\nTwo rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.\n\nGiven two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]\nOutput: false\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nrec1.length == 4\nrec2.length == 4\n-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109\nrec1 and rec2 represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isRectangleOverlap(vector<int>& rec1, vector<int>& rec2) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
