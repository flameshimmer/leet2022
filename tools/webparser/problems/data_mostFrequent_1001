{"title":"800. Similar RGB Color","description":"The red-green-blue color \"#AABBCC\" can be written as \"#ABC\" in shorthand.\n\nFor example, \"#15c\" is shorthand for the color \"#1155cc\".\n\nThe similarity between the two colors \"#ABCDEF\" and \"#UVWXYZ\" is -(AB - UV)2 - (CD - WX)2 - (EF - YZ)2.\n\nGiven a string color that follows the format \"#ABCDEF\", return a string represents the color that is most similar to the given color and has a shorthand (i.e., it can be represented as some \"#XYZ\").\n\nAny answer which has the same highest similarity as the best answer will be accepted.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: color = \"#09f166\"\nOutput: \"#11ee66\"\nExplanation: \nThe similarity is -(0x09 - 0x11)2 -(0xf1 - 0xee)2 - (0x66 - 0x66)2 = -64 -9 -0 = -73.\nThis is the highest among any shorthand color.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: color = \"#4e3fe1\"\nOutput: \"#5544dd\"\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\ncolor.length == 7\ncolor[0] == '#'\ncolor[i] is either digit or character in the range ['a', 'f'] for i > 0.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string similarRGB(string color) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
