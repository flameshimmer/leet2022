{"title":"1794. Count Pairs of Equal Substrings With Minimum Difference","description":"You are given two strings firstString and secondString that are 0-indexed and consist only of lowercase English letters. Count the number of index quadruples (i,j,a,b) that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n0 <= i <= j < firstString.length\n0 <= a <= b < secondString.length\nThe substring of firstString that starts at the ith character and ends at the jth character (inclusive) is equal to the substring of secondString that starts at the ath character and ends at the bth character (inclusive).\nj - a is the minimum possible value among all quadruples that satisfy the previous conditions.\n\nReturn the number of such quadruples.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: firstString = \"abcd\", secondString = \"bccda\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The quadruple (0,0,4,4) is the only one that satisfies all the conditions and minimizes j - a.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: firstString = \"ab\", secondString = \"cd\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no quadruples satisfying all the conditions.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= firstString.length, secondString.length <= 2 * 105\nBoth strings consist only of lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int countQuadruples(string firstString, string secondString) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
