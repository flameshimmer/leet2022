{"title":"363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K","description":"Given an m x n matrix matrix and an integer k, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be a rectangle with a sum no larger than k.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Because the sum of the blue rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[2,2,-1]], k = 3\nOutput: 3\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == matrix.length\nn == matrix[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 100\n-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100\n-105 <= k <= 105\n\n \n\nFollow up: What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int maxSumSubmatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
