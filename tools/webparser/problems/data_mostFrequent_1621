{"title":"1284. Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix","description":"Given a m x n binary matrix mat. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighbors if they share one edge.\n\nReturn the minimum number of steps required to convert mat to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot.\n\nA binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.\n\nA zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mat = [[0]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Given matrix is a zero matrix. We do not need to change it.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: Given matrix cannot be a zero matrix.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == mat.length\nn == mat[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 3\nmat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
