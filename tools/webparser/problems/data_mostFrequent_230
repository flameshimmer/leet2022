{"title":"471. Encode String with Shortest Length","description":"Given a string s, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.\n\nThe encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. k should be a positive integer.\n\nIf an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aaa\"\nOutput: \"aaa\"\nExplanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaaaa\"\nOutput: \"5[a]\"\nExplanation: \"5[a]\" is shorter than \"aaaaa\" by 1 character.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aaaaaaaaaa\"\nOutput: \"10[a]\"\nExplanation: \"a9[a]\" or \"9[a]a\" are also valid solutions, both of them have the same length = 5, which is the same as \"10[a]\".\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 150\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string encode(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
