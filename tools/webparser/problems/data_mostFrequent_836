{"title":"275. H-Index II","description":"Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.\n\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each.\n\nIf there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: citations = [1,2,100]\nOutput: 2\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == citations.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n0 <= citations[i] <= 1000\ncitations is sorted in ascending order.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
