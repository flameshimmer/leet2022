{"title":"205. Isomorphic Strings","description":"Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.\n\nTwo strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.\n\nAll occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"egg\", t = \"add\"\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"foo\", t = \"bar\"\nOutput: false\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"paper\", t = \"title\"\nOutput: true\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\nt.length == s.length\ns and t consist of any valid ascii character.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
