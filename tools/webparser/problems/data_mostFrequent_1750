{"title":"187. Repeated DNA Sequences","description":"The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.\n\nFor example, \"ACGAATTCCG\" is a DNA sequence.\n\nWhen studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\n\nGiven a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT\"\nOutput: [\"AAAAACCCCC\",\"CCCCCAAAAA\"]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"AAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\nOutput: [\"AAAAAAAAAA\"]\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
