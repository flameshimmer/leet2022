{"title":"2303. Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes","description":"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array brackets where brackets[i] = [upperi, percenti] means that the ith tax bracket has an upper bound of upperi and is taxed at a rate of percenti. The brackets are sorted by upper bound (i.e. upperi-1 < upperi for 0 < i < brackets.length).\n\nTax is calculated as follows:\n\nThe first upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent0.\nThe next upper1 - upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent1.\nThe next upper2 - upper1 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent2.\nAnd so on.\n\nYou are given an integer income representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: brackets = [[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], income = 10\nOutput: 2.65000\nExplanation:\nThe first 3 dollars you earn are taxed at 50%. You have to pay $3 * 50% = $1.50 dollars in taxes.\nThe next 7 - 3 = 4 dollars you earn are taxed at 10%. You have to pay $4 * 10% = $0.40 dollars in taxes.\nThe final 10 - 7 = 3 dollars you earn are taxed at 25%. You have to pay $3 * 25% = $0.75 dollars in taxes.\nYou have to pay a total of $1.50 + $0.40 + $0.75 = $2.65 dollars in taxes.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: brackets = [[1,0],[4,25],[5,50]], income = 2\nOutput: 0.25000\nExplanation:\nThe first dollar you earn is taxed at 0%. You have to pay $1 * 0% = $0 dollars in taxes.\nThe second dollar you earn is taxed at 25%. You have to pay $1 * 25% = $0.25 dollars in taxes.\nYou have to pay a total of $0 + $0.25 = $0.25 dollars in taxes.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: brackets = [[2,50]], income = 0\nOutput: 0.00000\nExplanation:\nYou have no income to tax, so you have to pay a total of $0 dollars in taxes.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= brackets.length <= 100\n1 <= upperi <= 1000\n0 <= percenti <= 100\n0 <= income <= 1000\nupperi is sorted in ascending order.\nAll the values of upperi are unique.\nThe upper bound of the last tax bracket is greater than or equal to income.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    double calculateTax(vector<vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
