{"title":"2174. Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips II","description":"You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.\n\nIn one operation, you can choose any i and j that meet the following conditions:\n\n0 <= i < m\n0 <= j < n\ngrid[i][j] == 1\n\nand change the values of all cells in row i and column j to zero.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations needed to remove all 1's from grid.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nIn the first operation, change all cell values of row 1 and column 1 to zero.\nIn the second operation, change all cell values of row 0 and column 0 to zero.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nIn the first operation, change all cell values of row 1 and column 0 to zero.\nIn the second operation, change all cell values of row 2 and column 1 to zero.\nNote that we cannot perform an operation using row 1 and column 1 because grid[1][1] != 1.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0],[0,0]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThere are no 1's to remove so return 0.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 15\n1 <= m * n <= 15\ngrid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int removeOnes(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
