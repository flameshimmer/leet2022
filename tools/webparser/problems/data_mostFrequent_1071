{"title":"2204. Distance to a Cycle in Undirected Graph","description":"You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a connected undirected graph containing exactly one cycle. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [node1i, node2i] denotes that there is a bidirectional edge connecting node1i and node2i in the graph.\n\nThe distance between two nodes a and b is defined to be the minimum number of edges that are needed to go from a to b.\n\nReturn an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum distance between the ith node and any node in the cycle.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[0,1],[5,2],[6,5]]\nOutput: [1,0,0,0,0,1,2]\nExplanation:\nThe nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 form the cycle.\nThe distance from 0 to 1 is 1.\nThe distance from 1 to 1 is 0.\nThe distance from 2 to 2 is 0.\nThe distance from 3 to 3 is 0.\nThe distance from 4 to 4 is 0.\nThe distance from 5 to 2 is 1.\nThe distance from 6 to 2 is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 9, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2],[2,6],[6,7],[6,8],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]]\nOutput: [0,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,2]\nExplanation:\nThe nodes 0, 1, and 2 form the cycle.\nThe distance from 0 to 0 is 0.\nThe distance from 1 to 1 is 0.\nThe distance from 2 to 2 is 0.\nThe distance from 3 to 1 is 1.\nThe distance from 4 to 1 is 2.\nThe distance from 5 to 1 is 2.\nThe distance from 6 to 2 is 1.\nThe distance from 7 to 2 is 2.\nThe distance from 8 to 2 is 2.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 105\nedges.length == n\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= node1i, node2i <= n - 1\nnode1i != node2i\nThe graph is connected.\nThe graph has exactly one cycle.\nThere is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> distanceToCycle(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
