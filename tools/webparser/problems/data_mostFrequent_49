{"title":"127. Word Ladder","description":"A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:\n\nEvery adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.\nEvery si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.\nsk == endWord\n\nGiven two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: One shortest transformation sequence is \"hit\" -> \"hot\" -> \"dot\" -> \"dog\" -> cog\", which is 5 words long.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The endWord \"cog\" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= beginWord.length <= 10\nendWord.length == beginWord.length\n1 <= wordList.length <= 5000\nwordList[i].length == beginWord.length\nbeginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.\nbeginWord != endWord\nAll the words in wordList are unique.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
