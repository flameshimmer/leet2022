{"title":"1427. Perform String Shifts","description":"You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [directioni, amounti]:\n\ndirectioni can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).\namounti is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.\nA left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.\nSimilarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.\n\nReturn the final string after all operations.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abc\", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]\nOutput: \"cab\"\nExplanation: \n[0,1] means shift to left by 1. \"abc\" -> \"bca\"\n[1,2] means shift to right by 2. \"bca\" -> \"cab\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcdefg\", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: \"efgabcd\"\nExplanation:  \n[1,1] means shift to right by 1. \"abcdefg\" -> \"gabcdef\"\n[1,1] means shift to right by 1. \"gabcdef\" -> \"fgabcde\"\n[0,2] means shift to left by 2. \"fgabcde\" -> \"abcdefg\"\n[1,3] means shift to right by 3. \"abcdefg\" -> \"efgabcd\"\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 100\ns only contains lower case English letters.\n1 <= shift.length <= 100\nshift[i].length == 2\ndirectioni is either 0 or 1.\n0 <= amounti <= 100","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    string stringShift(string s, vector<vector<int>>& shift) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
