{"title":"422. Valid Word Square","description":"Given an array of strings words, return true if it forms a valid word square.\n\nA sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the same string, where 0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns).\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"abcd\",\"bnrt\",\"crmy\",\"dtye\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe 1st row and 1st column both read \"abcd\".\nThe 2nd row and 2nd column both read \"bnrt\".\nThe 3rd row and 3rd column both read \"crmy\".\nThe 4th row and 4th column both read \"dtye\".\nTherefore, it is a valid word square.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"abcd\",\"bnrt\",\"crm\",\"dt\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe 1st row and 1st column both read \"abcd\".\nThe 2nd row and 2nd column both read \"bnrt\".\nThe 3rd row and 3rd column both read \"crm\".\nThe 4th row and 4th column both read \"dt\".\nTherefore, it is a valid word square.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: words = [\"ball\",\"area\",\"read\",\"lady\"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nThe 3rd row reads \"read\" while the 3rd column reads \"lead\".\nTherefore, it is NOT a valid word square.\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 500\n1 <= words[i].length <= 500\nwords[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    bool validWordSquare(vector<string>& words) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
