{"title":"153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array","description":"Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:\n\n[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.\n[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.\n\nNotice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [11,13,15,17]\nOutput: 11\nExplanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. \n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 5000\n-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000\nAll the integers of nums are unique.\nnums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
