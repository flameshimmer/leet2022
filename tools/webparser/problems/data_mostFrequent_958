{"title":"2295. Replace Elements in an Array","description":"You are given a 0-indexed array nums that consists of n distinct positive integers. Apply m operations to this array, where in the ith operation you replace the number operations[i][0] with operations[i][1].\n\nIt is guaranteed that in the ith operation:\n\noperations[i][0] exists in nums.\noperations[i][1] does not exist in nums.\n\nReturn the array obtained after applying all the operations.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,4,6], operations = [[1,3],[4,7],[6,1]]\nOutput: [3,2,7,1]\nExplanation: We perform the following operations on nums:\n- Replace the number 1 with 3. nums becomes [3,2,4,6].\n- Replace the number 4 with 7. nums becomes [3,2,7,6].\n- Replace the number 6 with 1. nums becomes [3,2,7,1].\nWe return the final array [3,2,7,1].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2], operations = [[1,3],[2,1],[3,2]]\nOutput: [2,1]\nExplanation: We perform the following operations to nums:\n- Replace the number 1 with 3. nums becomes [3,2].\n- Replace the number 2 with 1. nums becomes [3,1].\n- Replace the number 3 with 2. nums becomes [2,1].\nWe return the array [2,1].\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\nm == operations.length\n1 <= n, m <= 105\nAll the values of nums are distinct.\noperations[i].length == 2\n1 <= nums[i], operations[i][0], operations[i][1] <= 106\noperations[i][0] will exist in nums when applying the ith operation.\noperations[i][1] will not exist in nums when applying the ith operation.","functionSig":"1\nclass Solution {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    vector<int> arrayChange(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& operations) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n};"}
