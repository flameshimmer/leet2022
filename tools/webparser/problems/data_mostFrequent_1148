{"title":"348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe","description":"Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:\n\nA move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.\nOnce a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.\nA player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.\n\nImplement the TicTacToe class:\n\nTicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.\nint move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"TicTacToe\", \"move\", \"move\", \"move\", \"move\", \"move\", \"move\", \"move\"]\n[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]\nOutput\n[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nExplanation\nTicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);\nAssume that player 1 is \"X\" and player 2 is \"O\" in the board.\nticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| | |\n| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).\n| | | |\n\nticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| |O|\n| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).\n| | | |\n\nticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| |O|\n| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).\n| | |X|\n\nticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| |O|\n| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).\n| | |X|\n\nticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| |O|\n| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).\n|X| |X|\n\nticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)\n|X| |O|\n|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).\n|X| |X|\n\nticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)\n|X| |O|\n|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).\n|X|X|X|\n\n\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 100\nplayer is 1 or 2.\n0 <= row, col < n\n(row, col) are unique for each different call to move.\nAt most n2 calls will be made to move.\n\n \n\nFollow-up: Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?","functionSig":"1\nclass TicTacToe {\n2\npublic:\n3\n    TicTacToe(int n) {\n4\n        \n5\n    }\n6\n    \n7\n    int move(int row, int col, int player) {\n8\n        \n9\n    }\n10\n};\n11\n​\n12\n/**\n13\n * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:\n14\n * TicTacToe* obj = new TicTacToe(n);\n15\n * int param_1 = obj->move(row,col,player);\n16\n */"}
