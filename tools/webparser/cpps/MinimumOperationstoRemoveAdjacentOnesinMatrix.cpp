//You are given a 0-indexed binary matrix grid. In one operation, you can flip
//any 1 in grid to be 0.
//A binary matrix is well-isolated if there is no 1 in the matrix that is
//4-directionally connected (i.e., horizontal and vertical) to another 1.
//Return the minimum number of operations to make grid well-isolated.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,1,1]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: Use 3 operations to change grid[0][1], grid[1][2], and grid[2][1]
//to 0.
//After, no more 1's are 4-directionally connected and grid is well-isolated.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There are no 1's in grid and it is well-isolated.
//No operations were done so return 0.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: None of the 1's are 4-directionally connected and grid is
//well-isolated.
//No operations were done so return 0.
// 
//Constraints:
//m == grid.length
//n == grid[i].length
//1 <= m, n <= 300
//grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
