//Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the kth
//smallest subarray sum.
//A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an
//array. A subarray sum is the sum of all elements in the subarray.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [2,1,3], k = 4
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The subarrays of [2,1,3] are:
//- [2] with sum 2
//- [1] with sum 1
//- [3] with sum 3
//- [2,1] with sum 3
//- [1,3] with sum 4
//- [2,1,3] with sum 6 
//Ordering the sums from smallest to largest gives 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6. The 4th
//smallest is 3.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: nums = [3,3,5,5], k = 7
//Output: 10
//Explanation: The subarrays of [3,3,5,5] are:
//- [3] with sum 3
//- [3] with sum 3
//- [5] with sum 5
//- [5] with sum 5
//- [3,3] with sum 6
//- [3,5] with sum 8
//- [5,5] with sum 10
//- [3,3,5], with sum 11
//- [3,5,5] with sum 13
//- [3,3,5,5] with sum 16
//Ordering the sums from smallest to largest gives 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13,
//16. The 7th smallest is 10.
// 
//Constraints:
//n == nums.length
//1 <= n <= 2 * 104
//1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
//1 <= k <= n * (n + 1) / 2
