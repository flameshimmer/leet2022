//Given a string s, encode the string such that its encoded length is the
//shortest.
//The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the
//square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. k should be a positive
//integer.
//If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it.
//If there are several solutions, return any of them.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "aaa"
//Output: "aaa"
//Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the
//input string, so we do not encode it.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "aaaaa"
//Output: "5[a]"
//Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "aaaaaaaaaa"
//Output: "10[a]"
//Explanation: "a9[a]" or "9[a]a" are also valid solutions, both of them have the
//same length = 5, which is the same as "10[a]".
// 
//Constraints:
//1 <= s.length <= 150
//s consists of only lowercase English letters.
