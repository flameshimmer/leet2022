//We track our current stitching position (st). For each iteration, we check all
//overlapping clips, and pick the one that advances our stitching position the
//furthest.
//Solution
//We sort our clips by the starting point. Since clips are sorted, we need to
//only analyze each clip once. For each round, we check all overlapping clips
//(clips[i][0] <= st) and advance our stitching position as far as we can (end =
//max(end, clips[i][1])).
//Return -1 if we cannot advance our stitching position (st == end).
