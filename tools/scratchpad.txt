//The idea is to store two numbers (nums[i] and nums[nums[i]]) at the same
//location.
//The important point to be noted is that all numbers in the array are less than
//size of the array.
//
//Example - Lets say we have two numbers in the array a = 3 , b = 2 and the size
//of the array is n = 5
//We can store both 3 and 2 in a as follows:-
//a = a + b * n
//To get initial value of a we do a%n
//To get the value of b we do a/n
//a = a + b * n = 3 + 2*5 = 13
//a % n = 13 % 5 = 3
//a / n = 13 / 5 = 2
//So we will use this technique to store two numbers in one location.
//Why is it important that all numbers must be less than size of the array ?
//Its because when we do
//    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
//    {
//        nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]]);
//    }
//There may be cases when we have lost the value of nums[i] as it has already
//been replaced by nums[nums[i]].
//So in such cases we need to get the previous values of nums[i] or a
//This is done by finding nums[nums[i]] % n
//    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
//    {
//        nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]]%n);
//    }
//Once we have stored two numbers in each location we can simply divide each
//number by n to get the desired output.
