1. I constantly feel I am torn apart into different messaging: going deep and going broad


When I go deep, I was told to deligate as much as possible
When I go broad, I was told I am lacking depth in document and provide value in deep. 


The timeline of my years looks below:
Year 1
1. Half 1: debiaser
2. Half 2: BA and MPC and ZDB and CDS and schematization

The benefit: I got the breadth of the problem space our team it trying to solve. The downside: I am overloaded and feeling extremely busy, but each of the area can only get a fraction of the time thus quality will be impacted. 

MPC: lack of execution support, other than me people are not doing work. Ended up spending a lot 
BA/CDS: was working closely with Patrick and Bala, was dealing with a lot of random last mintue asks at the time
ZDB: sketched out higher level idea, work delegated to Patrick to carry out
Schematization: context mostly

At the end of the day I feel extremely exhausted and I don't feel my PSC score justifies the PSC result I put in there. 

Year 2:
Team reorged early in the year. My work area swaped from Privacy into Signal Loss.
My TL duty includes: roadmap making, vision doc writing, working with Paul's team on re-prioritization and all hands slides preparing

1. Half 1: TL of the signal loss, time was spend on:
- hold out infra alignment
- Modeled attribution intial design and alignment (pulled out most effort after escalation)
- MPC alignment and descrepancy tests
- Deadcode removal


2. Half 2: TL of the signal loss, time was spend on:
- ATT de-id
- AggrID alignment, web modeled AggrID planning and execution
- Browser History
- external Lift dedup
- internal Lift onboarding AggrID
- Basic Ads Carve out

I was positioned as "POC for all signal and events infra", with an ambiguity on what this role acutally means given other people who are occupying the space:
Due to the nature of alignment with AEP, multiple senior eng were involved int he AggrID alignment, after the alignment wrapped up, Lengning/Hari/Hua/Huy were working on this space simultanously. The space has a large amount of surface areas, requires major surgery to the AdConv infra with tight timeline, ever changing plans and goals triggered by XFN, my vision of my role over here is to become the STO of the AggrID project, working with Huy(TL for Deterministic AggrID), Hua (TL for Modeled AggrID), Hari (overall STO for Prabhkar's space). 

During this period since my original project ownership of Web AggrID's scope and timeline had multiple changes, this has created a lot of center of attention for Modeled AggrID area. And since the web AggrID and App AggrID Hua was working have a large amount of component sharing, my focus was directed to clarification of the scope/timeline with partner team and calculate/ensuring we have sufficient amount of resource to complete the project in time. I mostly relied on Huy and Hua on execution of the AggrID project. This move however didn't sit well with Hua since she feels her PSC is at risk due to: 
1. Her focus is on execution but less on the planning and direction
2. She feel she was missed out from the XFN related discussion
3. In an ideal case, she want to independently operate on the Modeled AggrID space. 

The end result of this is when I operate what I think is what my responsibilty, Hua would feel I am taking away her oppotunities. Both of us had a lot of confusion in this place, because of this, XFN start to also sense the same confusion as who would be the POC from events infra. Should it be Hari/Lengning/Ning/Hua/Huy? I surfaced this concern to Yogesh regarding clarifying the responsibility
1.  the initial attempt to clarify the division of responsibiltiy with Hua, the answer I got was to "figure out myself with Hua". This approach is not working very well as at this time Hua start to show a lot of passive aggressive behavior and the communication effect is very limited. 

2. The secondary answer I got was I was sit down with Yogesh and Kefu, regarding shifting major Modeled AggrID short term responsibility to Hua, with me by her side to ensure success, and I shift more attention to roadmap making and other non-urgent project (Eg: Lift). This again was changed, due to later on XFN alignment was we no longer need to delivery short term solutions, and need to focus on longer term solution and there are a lot of work needed to figure out the gap and timeline. I took on this responsiblity since my understanding is Hua would be still focusing on execuation of the existing plan. However, this move did below things: 
1. this took away the time I was planning to spend on roadmap, and causes some jittery on when the roadmap would be done. The roadmap making task under Yogesh was later transfered to Haofeng, and the roadmap making task for Attribution performance was delayed for 3 weeks. 
2. Hua start to feel by me taking on the XFN work, she has limited space to operate in the space, and start to worry about her PSC. The behavior of passive aggressiveness heightened, and repeated communication with her had some effect but can't mitigate the whole issue. 

3. The third attempt to figure out the scope division with Hua was I drafted out a doc with Yogesh help to balance things out. Yogesh was planning to have a meeting with both me and Hua on the clarification but this was never carried out due to he was in sick leave. At this period of time I start to get feedback from Hari on my setup was not correct and my work on the breadth is hurting me. 

From my perspective, I feel my best intention and effort to perform well in an area is not appreciated and even if after a lot of hard work and even if the project is successful, I would still fail. This is the definition of setup for failure. Personally I don't have to work on any particular projects, I am completely open to shift any project from my scope to others, as long as the ownership is clarified between us. 

Yogesh sit down with me and walked me through on my growth area is hurting me more than it should, this includes:
1. Due to the large surface area, the amount of time spend on each area is less, thus impacting the quality of the work.  
2. I am not TL material, and far away from getting to the next level
3. He tried with many different growth plan with me, and because the way I work, they didn't pan out. 

He also offered two options:
1. Worked on Reliability area with Ritesh, and maybe take over the area after he moved to work on something else
2. Moved to Aggregator team under Karthik, and reset from there. 

From my perspective I feel:
1. When the different growth plan was thrown to me, it was more of an oppotunity than a real plan. It lacked the understanding of where I am in the team, what kind of work will help me to land a solid fundation in the team as a TL, and more gearing towards of 1) Just throw Ning the first thing that comes next so the check is checked2) After pointing me to the direction, lack of support and follow up to help me successfully onboard that place (Eg: lack of clarification of my role for AggrID) 3) Cast all blame to me when things are not going on right 4) When realizing I am overloaded, didn't help to remove the responsibility away, but simply ask me to delegate out while having no thought process on clarification of my responsibility versus others. 

I feel overworked, under appreciated, having to deal with conflicts from both inside and outside the team, being responsible for a very risky project but have no clarification on my role and no space to operate. I am looking for a new begining to reset all these and get back on my career track.
